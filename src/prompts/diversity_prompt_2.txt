Please output the clusters strictly following the below format, each row containing a cluster, names, and reasons. Do not include any additional text or explanations outside of this format:

cluster1\t[solution names]\treason for cluster
cluster2\t[solution names]\treason for cluster
cluster3\t[solution names]\treason for cluster
...

For example:
cluster1\t[Solution 1, Solution 3, Solution 5]\tsimilar algebraic approach using the volume formula and canceling terms or directly solving for the height.
cluster2\t[Solution 2, Solution 4]\tverifying the correctness and consistency of the formula and solution and considering unit checks or logical reasoning on how volume relates to base area and height.
