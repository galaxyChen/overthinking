Explanation:

Solution Analysis: To start, we will break down the solution into its key components. Notably, the answer 1024 is only found in step 44. We will then conduct a detailed analysis of each solution. Steps 42 to 44 comprise a cohesive sequence that leads to the answer of 1024 ways. In accordance with rule 1, these steps should be regarded as a single, unified solution. In contrast, step 45 marks the beginning of a verification process that extends to step 50, but ultimately remains incomplete.


Completeness Analysis: The first solution consists of step 42 to step 44, is complete as it provides a definitive answer of 1024. On the other hand, steps 45 to 50 are incomplete, as they have not yielded an answer.

Answer Analysis: The first solution yields an answer of 1024. However, the second solution is incomplete, resulting in an answer of "none".
