Question:
"""
A curve is parameterized by
\[(x,y) = (t^3 + 7, -3t^2 - 6t - 5).\]Find the point the curve passes through at $t = 2.$
"""

Response:
"""
I wonder if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe by plugging t = 2 into the parametric equations again? Let me try that. For x: t = 2, so x = (2)^3 + 7 = 8 + 7 = 15. For y: -3*(2)^2 -6*(2) -5 = -3*4 -12 -5 = -12 -12 -5 = -29. Same result. Okay, so that confirms it. I think that's all there is to it. The key was just substituting t = 2 into both equations and simplifying step by step. No calculus needed here, just substitution. Sometimes parametric equations can be tricky if you have to find derivatives or something, but this is straightforward substitution. I don't see any possible errors in my calculations, so I think the answer is (15, -29).

**Final Answer**
The point the curve passes through at \( t = 2 \) is \boxed{(15, -29)}.
