Question:
"""
Determine the remainder of 54 (mod 6).
"""

Solution:
"""
###STEP 29
So I need to find the remainder when 54 is divided by 6. I remember that modulo operation gives us the remainder after division. For example, 10 modulo 3 is 1 because 10 divided by 3 is 3 with a remainder of 1.

###STEP 30
Let me apply that here. 54 divided by 6. I know that 6 times 9 is 54, so 6 * 9 = 54. That means 54 divided by 6 is exactly 9 with no remainder.

###STEP 31
So, the remainder should be 0.

###STEP 32
Wait, let me double-check. If 6 goes into 54 exactly 9 times without any leftover, then yes, the remainder is 0.

###STEP 33
Alternatively, I can think about it in terms of the modulo operation. 54 mod 6 should be 54 - (6 * floor(54/6)). The floor of 54 divided by 6 is 9, so 6 * 9 = 54. Then, 54 - 54 = 0.

###STEP 34
Yes, that confirms it.

###STEP 35
So, the remainder is 0.

###STEP 36
**Final Answer**

###STEP 37
\[ \boxed{0} \]
