Criteria for clustering the mathematical solutions: 
1. If the solutions used to arrive at the solutions are fundamentally different from each other, such as algebraic manipulation versus geometric reasoning, they can be considered novel;
2. Even if the results are the same, if the intermediate steps or processes involved in reaching those solutions vary significantly, the solutions can be considered different;
3. If the solutions relies on different assumptions or conditions, they should be considered different from each other;
4. A solution might generalize to a broader class of problems, while another solution might be specific to certain conditions. In such cases, they are considered distinct;
5. If one solution is significantly simpler or more complex than the others, it can be regarded as essentially novel, even if they lead to the same result.
