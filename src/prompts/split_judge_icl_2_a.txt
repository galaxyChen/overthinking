Explaination: To judge whether the ending mark is reasonable, we need to analyze the context of the response. The response appears to be a solution to a problem, but the problem presented is about quadratic equations, while the response is about arranging letters in the word "ELLIPSE". The ending mark <end> seems to separate the main thinking process from a potential additional verification or alternative approach that the student considers after the mark. So, based on the rules provided and the context of the response (even though it doesn't match the question), the ending mark could be considered reasonable because it separates two thinking processes and the part before it contains an explicit answer to the problem the student is actually solving.
