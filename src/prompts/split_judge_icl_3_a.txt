Explaination: To determine whether the ending mark `<end>` is reasonable, let's analyze the context and the rules provided. The response is a solution to a problem involving a parameterized curve, where the task is to find the point the curve passes through at a given value of $t$. The solution involves substituting $t = 2$ into the parametric equations for $x$ and $y$, and then simplifying to find the point $(x, y)$. The part before the `<end>` mark contains an explicit calculation and confirmation of the answer, which is $(15, -29)$. After the `<end>` mark, the response simply states the final answer in a formatted way, which can be seen as a conclusion or a summary of the solution found before the mark. According to the rule 3, this ending is not reasonable.
