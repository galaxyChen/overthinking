Explaination: To determine whether the ending mark `<end>` is reasonable, let's analyze the context and the rules provided. The response provided is a solution to a problem involving quadratic equations and their roots. The solution outlines different cases (Case 1, Case 2, Case 3) before the `<end>` mark, suggesting that these cases represent different types of quadratic equations that satisfy the given condition. After the `<end>` mark, the solution delves deeper into validating one of the cases (Case 2) and concludes that there are indeed more valid quadratics than initially considered. The part before the `<end>` mark does contain an explicit mention of having found solutions, according to rule 2, the ending mark is not reasonable.
