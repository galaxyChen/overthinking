Question:
"""
There is a collection of $25$ indistinguishable white chips and $25$ indistinguishable black chips. Find the number of ways to place some of these chips in the $25$ unit cells of a $5\times5$ grid such that: 

each cell contains at most one chip
all chips in the same row and all chips in the same column have the same colour
any additional chip placed on the grid would violate one or more of the previous two conditions.
"""

Solution:
"""
### Step 42
Wait, actually, each assignment of row and column colors uniquely determines the chip placement, as per the rules we've established.

### Step 43
Moreover, different assignments will lead to different chip placements, because the color assignments uniquely determine which cells are occupied and with which color.

### Step 44
Therefore, the total number of ways to place the chips is equal to the number of ways to assign colors to the rows and columns, which is 2^10 = 1024.

### Step 45
But wait, let's double-check this.

### Step 46
Is there any restriction on the color assignments?

### Step 47
For example, is there a requirement that all rows and columns must be assigned at least one color?

### Step 48
Or, is there a requirement that the grid must have some minimum number of chips placed?

### Step 49
Looking back at the problem, the only conditions are:

### Step 50
1. Each cell contains at most one chip.
