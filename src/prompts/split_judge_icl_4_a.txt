Explaination: To determine whether the ending mark `<end>` is reasonable, let's analyze the context and the rules provided. The response appears to be a solution to a problem involving a regular tetrahedron, where the task is to find the surface area of one of the pieces after it's cut by a plane. The part before the `<end>` mark discusses the coordinates of certain points (E, F, G, H) and considers projecting them onto the xz-plane, realizing that this approach would lead to an incorrect area calculation due to the collapse of points E and F. After the `<end>` mark, the response explores an alternative approach by projecting the points onto the xy-plane, which suggests a continuation of the thinking process to find a correct method for calculating the surface area. Even though the ending mark separates two different thinking processes to solving the problem, according to the rule 2, it is not reasonable because the part before the ending mark does not contain an explicit answer.
