Solution:
"""
### STEP 1
So I have this problem here: convert the point (0,3) in rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates. I need to find the polar coordinates in the form (r, θ), where r is greater than 0 and θ is between 0 and 2π. Alright, let's start by recalling how to convert from rectangular (Cartesian) coordinates to polar coordinates.

### STEP 2
I know that in polar coordinates, a point is defined by its distance from the origin (that's r) and the angle it makes with the positive x-axis (that's θ). The formulas to convert from rectangular coordinates (x, y) to polar coordinates (r, θ) are:

### STEP 3
r = √(x² + y²)

### STEP 4
θ = arctan(y/x)

### STEP 5
But I have to be careful with the angle θ because the arctan function only returns values between -π/2 and π/2, and I need to adjust it based on the quadrant in which the point lies to get the correct angle between 0 and 2π.

### STEP 6
Given the point (0,3), let's identify x and y:

### STEP 7
x = 0

### STEP 8
y = 3

### STEP 9
First, let's find r:

### STEP 10
r = √(0² + 3²) = √(0 + 9) = √9 = 3

### STEP 11
So, r = 3.

### STEP 12
Now, let's find θ. The formula is θ = arctan(y/x), but in this case, x = 0, which would make the denominator zero. That means tanθ is undefined, which happens at angles where θ is π/2 or 3π/2.

### STEP 13
Looking at the point (0,3), it's located on the positive y-axis. So, the angle from the positive x-axis to the positive y-axis is π/2 radians (90 degrees).

### STEP 14
Therefore, θ = π/2.

### STEP 15
So, the polar coordinates should be (3, π/2).

### STEP 16
But just to double-check, let's consider the conditions for θ. Since the point is on the positive y-axis, and the arctan function would normally return -π/2 or π/2, but in this case, because x is 0 and y is positive, θ is indeed π/2.

### STEP 17
Also, since r is positive and θ is between 0 and 2π, this satisfies the requirements.

### STEP 18
Therefore, the polar coordinates are (3, π/2).

### STEP 19
**Final Answer**

### STEP 20
\[ \boxed{\left(3,\,\frac{\pi}{2}\right)} \]
