Here is a small snippet of a student's solution to a problem, and there is an ending mark in the snippet. Please read the step and judge whether the ending mark is reasonable.

Input description:
The input contains three part: a question and a response. The response is a snippet of text and there will be an ending mark <end> in the text.

Your task:
Judge whether the ending mark is reasonable based on the context.

Rules to define a reasonable ending mark:
1. A reasonable ending mark should separate two thinking process. 
2. The ending of the part before the ending mark should must be logically complete and contain an answer explicitly.
3. If the part after the ending mark is a simple conclusion, e.g. just presenting the final answer, then the ending mark is not reasonable.

Output format:
First, you need to analyze the input. Then, you should return the result in json format, with a key named "result" and a boolean value indicating whether the ending mark is reasonable.


Question:
"""
Find the number of quadratic equations of the form $x^2 + ax + b = 0,$ such that whenever $c$ is a root of the equation, $c^2 - 2$ is also a root of the equation.
"""

Response:
"""
Therefore, in total, we have:

- Case 1: Two quadratics.

- Case 2: One quadratic.

- Case 3: One quadratic.
<end>
Wait, but hold on. Let's check if Case 2 is valid. If we have a quadratic with roots 2 and -1, then indeed, each root is a fixed point. So, applying the operation c ↦ c² - 2 to 2 gives 2² - 2 = 2, and to -1 gives (-1)^2 - 2 = 1 - 2 = -1. So, yes, the set {2, -1} is closed under the operation. Therefore, this quadratic is valid. So, that's another quadratic equation.

But in my initial analysis, I considered Case 1 as repeated roots, but actually, the quadratic with distinct roots 2 and -1 is also valid. So, that's a third quadratic.
