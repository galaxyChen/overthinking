Question:
"""
Find the number of quadratic equations of the form $x^2 + ax + b = 0,$ such that whenever $c$ is a root of the equation, $c^2 - 2$ is also a root of the equation.
"""

Response:
"""
Wait, but in the quartic equation, when we had r = -1 and r = 2, those corresponded to repeated roots. But if we take both 2 and -1 as roots, that's a separate quadratic. So, perhaps I need to consider:

Total quadratics:

1. x² - 4x + 4 = 0 (repeated root 2)

2. x² + 2x + 1 = 0 (repeated root -1)

3. x² - x - 2 = 0 (roots 2 and -1)
<end>
4. x² + x - 1 = 0 (roots [ -1 ± sqrt(5) ] / 2 )

Therefore, total of four quadratics.
