Here is a student's response to a problem, please read the response and insert some xml tags into the response to separate different solutions.

Input description:
Each step in the response is labeled with ###STEP. The response may not be complete, and the label of steps may not starts with 1.

Definition of "solution":
A "solution" is a complete process of solving the problem, and a solution should end with an answer explicitly. For example, if the problem is a multiple choice question, then the solution should contain an option. If the problem is a math problem, then the soluition should contain the values requested in the problem. If there is no clear answer from the analysis, then the answer should be "none".

Your task:
Extract all sub-solutions in the response that contain an answer explicitly.

Notes to extract answer:
1. Don't care about the correctness of the solution, just extract them and present the answer in it.
2. The student may verify or reflect the solution after getting one answer, or try another way to solve the problem. Once you see a valid answer, mark it as a solution, and leave the verification, reflection and different exploration to the next solution. Note: When a reflection process arrives at an answer, whether or not that answer is consistent with the previous answer, the process *should be* regarded as a solution, too.
3. Different solution may contain the same answer, just extract them all.
4. The beginning of the response may be the second half of an existing solution, and when it gets an answer, it is considered a complete solution. The end of the response may stop in the middle of an solution, and it is considered an incomplete solution.

Rules to extract answer:
1. Whenever you see an explicit answer, that's a solution.
2. Double-Check or verification is considered a solution.
3. Some steps at the ending of the response may not contain any reasoning process and just a conclusion of the current solution, these steps should be merged to the last soluition.
4. Single Step Solution: if one single step contains a complete reasoning (or double-check) process and an answer, then it should be treated as a single step soluition.

Output format:
Use <solution*N*></solution*N*> the wrap different trials.
You should only return the steps around the boundary of solution, use "..." to obmit content in between. 
Note that the first step of a solution should be the next step of the last step in last solution. 
If a step itself is a complete solution, then the first and last step of the solution will be that step.
Use <step></step> to wrap steps and use <answer></answer> to highlight the answer in a soluition tag.
You should use a <complete></complete> tag to denote whether the solution has an explicit answer or it is just a partial solution.


Question:
"""
What is the positive square root of the product $10 \times 15 \times 24$?
"""

Solution:
"""
###STEP 1
So I need to find the positive square root of the product of 10, 15, and 24. First, I should calculate the product of these three numbers.

###STEP 2
Let's multiply them step by step.

###STEP 3
First, 10 times 15 is 150.

###STEP 4
Then, 150 times 24.

###STEP 5
To make it easier, I can break it down:

###STEP 6
150 times 20 is 3000.

###STEP 7
150 times 4 is 600.

###STEP 8
So, 3000 plus 600 is 3600.

###STEP 9
So, the product of 10, 15, and 24 is 3600.

###STEP 10
Now, I need to find the positive square root of 3600.

###STEP 11
I know that 60 times 60 is 3600.

###STEP 12
So, the square root of 3600 is 60.

###STEP 13
Therefore, the positive square root of the product of 10, 15, and 24 is 60.

###STEP 14
**Final Answer**

###STEP 15
\[ \boxed{60} \]
