Question:
"""
Mrs. Hilt found a quarter, 1 dime, and 2 nickels. How much money did she find?
"""

One Step From Student's Response:
"""
Okay, let's see here. Mrs. Hilt found some coins, and I need to figure out how much money that totals. The coins she found are a quarter, a dime, and two nickels. Alright, so I need to remember the values of each of these coins. Let me start by recalling how much each coin is worth in cents because that might be easier to add up first before converting to dollars if needed.
"""

Expected Answer:
"""
$0.45
