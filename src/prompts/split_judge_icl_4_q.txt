Question:
"""
Let $ABCD$ be a regular tetrahedron with side length 2. The plane parallel to edges $AB$ and $CD$ and lying halfway between them cuts $ABCD$ into two pieces. Find the surface area of one of these pieces.
"""

Response:
"""
The coordinates in the xz-plane are:

E: (-1/(2√3), √6 /3 )

F: (-1/(2√3), √6 /3 )

G: (1/(2√3), 0 )

H: (1/(2√3), 0 )

But projecting onto the xz-plane, points E and F have the same x and z coordinates, so the projection would collapse them into a single point, making the area calculation incorrect.
<end>
Alternatively, project onto the xy-plane:

E: (-1/(2√3), 1/2 )

F: (-1/(2√3), -1/2 )

G: (1/(2√3), 1/2 )

H: (1/(2√3), -1/2 )
