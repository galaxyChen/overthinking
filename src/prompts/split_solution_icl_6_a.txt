Explanation:

Solution Analysis: We will begin by examining the steps that explicitly contain the answer. Notably, steps 15 and 18 collectively provide the solution, which is (3, π/2). Next, we will conduct a detailed analysis of each solution. The initial part of the solution, based on rule 1, spans steps 1 to 15 and yields an answer of (3, π/2). Steps 16 to 18 serve as a verification, reaffirming the previously obtained result. Therefore, steps 1 to 15 comprise the first solution, and steps 16 to 18 constitute the second solution, which is based on rule 2. Finally, steps 19 and 20 form the conclusion, and according to rule 3, they will be merged with the second solution.

Completeness Analysis: The first solution and the second solution are both complete.

Answer Analysis: Notably, both solutions incorporate a definitive answer, which is (3, π/2).
