How many such numbers are there?\n\n**Reference Answer**\n432\n\n**Student Solution**:\nTo determine how many 4-digit numbers beginning with 1 have exactly two identical digits, we need to consider the structure of these numbers. A number of this form can be represented as \\(1abc\\), where \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are digits from 0 to 9, and exactly one of the digits \\(a\\), \\(b\\), or \\(c\\) is 1, while the other two are different from each other and different from 1.\n\nWe can break down the problem into the following steps:\n\n1. **Choose the digit that is 1**: There are 3 positions (a, b, c) where the digit 1 can be placed. So, there are 3 choices for the position of the digit 1.\n\n2. **Choose the other two digits**: The remaining two digits must be different from each other and different from 1. Therefore, we have 9 choices for the first of these two digits (0-9 except 1) and 8 choices for the second digit (0-9 except 1 and the first digit). This gives us \\(9 \\times 8 = 72\\) choices for the other two digits.\n\nCombining these choices, the total number of 4-digit numbers beginning with 1 that have exactly two identical digits is:\n\\[3 \\times 72 = 216.\\]\n\nThus, the number of such numbers is \\(\\boxed{216}\\).<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n## Student Final Answer\n216\n\n## Equivalence Judgement\nFALSE\n\n## Justification\nThe student's answer of 216 is incorrect in the context of the problem, which asks for the total count of 4-digit numbers beginning with 1 that have exactly two identical digits.

However, the problem also includes the scenario where the identical digits could be different from '1'. Thus, the student's calculation does not account for all valid configurations.
