Then 2! is 2, so 2! * 2! is 2 * 2 = 4. Then 5040 divided by 4 is 1260. So is the answer 1260? Hmm, but let me make sure I didn't miss any other duplicates. The letters in ELLIPSE are E, L, L, I, P, S, E. So E and L each have two, the rest are single. So yeah, that should be correct.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake in counting the letters. Let me list them again: E, L, L, I, P, S, E. So that's two Es, two Ls, and one each of I, P, S. So total letters: 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 7. Yep, that's right. So the formula is 7! divided by (number of duplicates factorial). Since there are two letters with duplicates, each duplicated twice, so 2! for E and 2! for L. So 7! / (2! * 2!) = 5040 / 4 = 1260.\n<end>\nBut let me verify this with another approach. Suppose I first consider all the letters as distinct. Then there would be 7! ways. But since some letters are the same, we have to divide by the permutations of the identical letters.

So that gives the same result.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it step by step. Let's say I want to arrange the 7 letters. First, choose positions for the Es. There are C(7,2) ways to choose positions for the two Es. Then, from the remaining 5 positions, choose positions for the two Ls, which is C(5,2).

Maybe I made a mistake in counting the letters. Let me list them again: E, L, L, I, P, S, E. So that's two Es, two Ls, and one each of I, P, S. So total letters: 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 7. Yep, that's right. So the formula is 7! divided by (number of duplicates factorial). Since there are two letters with duplicates, each duplicated twice, so 2! for E and 2! for L. So 7! / (2! * 2!) = 5040 / 4 = 1260.\n<end>\nBut let me verify this with another approach. Suppose I first consider all the letters as distinct. Then there would be 7! ways. But since some letters are the same, we have to divide by the permutations of the identical letters. So for the two Es, if they were different, we would have 2! more permutations, but since they are the same, we divide by 2!. Similarly for the two Ls, divide by 2!. So that gives the same result.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it step by step. Let's say I want to arrange the 7 letters. First, choose positions for the Es. There are C(7,2) ways to choose positions for the two Es. Then, from the remaining 5 positions, choose positions for the two Ls, which is C(5,2). Then, the remaining 3 letters (I, P, S) can be arranged in 3! ways. So total number of arrangements would be C(7,2) * C(5,2) * 3!.

The letters in ELLIPSE are E, L, L, I, P, S, E. So E and L each have two, the rest are single. So yeah, that should be correct.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake in counting the letters. Let me list them again: E, L, L, I, P, S, E. So that's two Es, two Ls, and one each of I, P, S. So total letters: 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 7. Yep, that's right. So the formula is 7! divided by (number of duplicates factorial). Since there are two letters with duplicates, each duplicated twice, so 2! for E and 2! for L.

The letters in ELLIPSE are E, L, L, I, P, S, E. So E and L each have two, the rest are single. So yeah, that should be correct.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake in counting the letters. Let me list them again: E, L, L, I, P, S, E. So that's two Es, two Ls, and one each of I, P, S. So total letters: 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 7. Yep, that's right. So the formula is 7! divided by (number of duplicates factorial). Since there are two letters with duplicates, each duplicated twice, so 2! for E and 2! for L.

The letters in ELLIPSE are E, L, L, I, P, S, E. So E and L each have two, the rest are single. So yeah, that should be correct.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake in counting the letters. Let me list them again: E, L, L, I, P, S, E. So that's two Es, two Ls, and one each of I, P, S. So total letters: 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 7. Yep, that's right. So the formula is 7! divided by (number of duplicates factorial). Since there are two letters with duplicates, each duplicated twice, so 2! for E and 2! for L.

Then 2! is 2, so 2! * 2! is 2 * 2 = 4. Then 5040 divided by 4 is 1260. So is the answer 1260? Hmm, but let me make sure I didn't miss any other duplicates. The letters in ELLIPSE are E, L, L, I, P, S, E. So E and L each have two, the rest are single. So yeah, that should be correct.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake in counting the letters. Let me list them again: E, L, L, I, P, S, E. So that's two Es, two Ls, and one each of I, P, S. So total letters: 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 7. Yep, that's right. So the formula is 7! divided by (number of duplicates factorial). Since there are two letters with duplicates, each duplicated twice, so 2! for E and 2! for L. So 7! / (2! * 2!) = 5040 / 4 = 1260.\n<end>\nBut let me verify this with another approach. Suppose I first consider all the letters as distinct. Then there would be 7! ways. But since some letters are the same, we have to divide by the permutations of the identical letters. So for the two Es, if they were different, we would have 2! more permutations, but since they are the same, we divide by 2!. Similarly for the two Ls, divide by 2!. So that gives the same result.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it step by step. Let's say I want to arrange the 7 letters. First, choose positions for the Es. There are C(7,2) ways to choose positions for the two Es. Then, from the remaining 5 positions, choose positions for the two Ls, which is C(5,2). Then, the remaining 3 letters (I, P, S) can be arranged in 3! ways. So total number of arrangements would be C(7,2) * C(5,2) * 3!.

The letters in ELLIPSE are E, L, L, I, P, S, E. So E and L each have two, the rest are single. So yeah, that should be correct.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake in counting the letters. Let me list them again: E, L, L, I, P, S, E. So that's two Es, two Ls, and one each of I, P, S. So total letters: 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 7. Yep, that's right. So the formula is 7! divided by (number of duplicates factorial). Since there are two letters with duplicates, each duplicated twice, so 2! for E and 2! for L. So 7! / (2! * 2!) = 5040 / 4 = 1260.\n<end>\nBut let me verify this with another approach. Suppose I first consider all the letters as distinct. Then there would be 7! ways.

So for the two Es, if they were different, we would have 2! more permutations, but since they are the same, we divide by 2!. Similarly for the two Ls, divide by 2!. So that gives the same result.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it step by step. Let's say I want to arrange the 7 letters. First, choose positions for the Es. There are C(7,2) ways to choose positions for the two Es. Then, from the remaining 5 positions, choose positions for the two Ls, which is C(5,2).

Then 2! is 2, so 2! * 2! is 2 * 2 = 4. Then 5040 divided by 4 is 1260. So is the answer 1260? Hmm, but let me make sure I didn't miss any other duplicates. The letters in ELLIPSE are E, L, L, I, P, S, E. So E and L each have two, the rest are single. So yeah, that should be correct.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake in counting the letters. Let me list them again: E, L, L, I, P, S, E. So that's two Es, two Ls, and one each of I, P, S. So total letters: 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 7. Yep, that's right. So the formula is 7! divided by (number of duplicates factorial). Since there are two letters with duplicates, each duplicated twice, so 2! for E and 2! for L.

The letters in ELLIPSE are E, L, L, I, P, S, E. So E and L each have two, the rest are single. So yeah, that should be correct.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake in counting the letters. Let me list them again: E, L, L, I, P, S, E. So that's two Es, two Ls, and one each of I, P, S. So total letters: 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 7. Yep, that's right. So the formula is 7! divided by (number of duplicates factorial). Since there are two letters with duplicates, each duplicated twice, so 2! for E and 2! for L.

The letters in ELLIPSE are E, L, L, I, P, S, E. So E and L each have two, the rest are single. So yeah, that should be correct.\n\nBut wait, let me think again.

Yep, that's right. So the formula is 7! divided by (number of duplicates factorial). Since there are two letters with duplicates, each duplicated twice, so 2! for E and 2! for L.

The letters in ELLIPSE are E, L, L, I, P, S, E. So E and L each have two, the rest are single. So yeah, that should be correct.\n\nBut wait, let me think again.

Yep, that's right. So the formula is 7! divided by (number of duplicates factorial). Since there are two letters with duplicates, each duplicated twice, so 2! for E and 2! for L.

The letters in ELLIPSE are E, L, L, I, P, S, E. So E and L each have two, the rest are single. So yeah, that should be correct.\n\nBut wait, let me think again.

Yep, that's right. So the formula is 7! divided by (number of duplicates factorial). Since there are two letters with duplicates, each duplicated twice, so 2! for E and 2! for L.

The letters in ELLIPSE are E, L, L, I, P, S, E. So E and L each have two, the rest are single. So yeah, that should be correct.\n\nBut wait, let me think again.

Yep, that's right. So the formula is 7! divided by (number of duplicates factorial). Since there are two letters with duplicates, each duplicated twice, so 2! for E and 2! for L.

Then 2! is 2, so 2! * 2! is 2 * 2 = 4. Then 5040 divided by 4 is 1260. So is the answer 1260? Hmm, but let me make sure I didn't miss any other duplicates. The letters in ELLIPSE are E, L, L, I, P, S, E. So E and L each have two, the rest are single. So yeah, that should be correct.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake in counting the letters. Let me list them again: E, L, L, I, P, S, E. So that's two Es, two Ls, and one each of I, P, S. So total letters: 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 7. Yep, that's right. So the formula is 7! divided by (number of duplicates factorial). Since there are two letters with duplicates, each duplicated twice, so 2! for E and 2! for L. So 7! / (2! * 2!) = 5040 / 4 = 1260.\n<end>\nBut let me verify this with another approach. Suppose I first consider all the letters as distinct. Then there would be 7! ways. But since some letters are the same, we have to divide by the permutations of the identical letters. So for the two Es, if they were different, we would have 2! more permutations, but since they are the same, we divide by 2!. Similarly for the two Ls, divide by 2!. So that gives the same result.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it step by step. Let's say I want to arrange the 7 letters. First, choose positions for the Es. There are C(7,2) ways to choose positions for the two Es. Then, from the remaining 5 positions, choose positions for the two Ls, which is C(5,2).

Then 2! is 2, so 2! * 2! is 2 * 2 = 4. Then 5040 divided by 4 is 1260. So is the answer 1260? Hmm, but let me make sure I didn't miss any other duplicates. The letters in ELLIPSE are E, L, L, I, P, S, E. So E and L each have two, the rest are single. So yeah, that should be correct.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake in counting the letters. Let me list them again: E, L, L, I, P, S, E. So that's two Es, two Ls, and one each of I, P, S. So total letters: 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 7. Yep, that's right. So the formula is 7! divided by (number of duplicates factorial). Since there are two letters with duplicates, each duplicated twice, so 2! for E and 2! for L. So 7! / (2! * 2!) = 5040 / 4 = 1260.\n<end>\nBut let me verify this with another approach. Suppose I first consider all the letters as distinct. Then there would be 7! ways. But since some letters are the same, we have to divide by the permutations of the identical letters. So for the two Es, if they were different, we would have 2! more permutations, but since they are the same, we divide by 2!. Similarly for the two Ls, divide by 2!. So that gives the same result.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it step by step. Let's say I want to arrange the 7 letters. First, choose positions for the Es. There are C(7,2) ways to choose positions for the two Es. Then, from the remaining 5 positions, choose positions for the two Ls, which is C(5,2). Then, the remaining 3 letters (I, P, S) can be arranged in 3! ways. So total number of arrangements would be C(7,2) * C(5,2) * 3!.

Then 2! is 2, so 2! * 2! is 2 * 2 = 4. Then 5040 divided by 4 is 1260. So is the answer 1260? Hmm, but let me make sure I didn't miss any other duplicates. The letters in ELLIPSE are E, L, L, I, P, S, E. So E and L each have two, the rest are single. So yeah, that should be correct.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake in counting the letters. Let me list them again: E, L, L, I, P, S, E. So that's two Es, two Ls, and one each of I, P, S. So total letters: 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 7. Yep, that's right. So the formula is 7! divided by (number of duplicates factorial). Since there are two letters with duplicates, each duplicated twice, so 2! for E and 2! for L. So 7! / (2! * 2!) = 5040 / 4 = 1260.\n<end>\nBut let me verify this with another approach. Suppose I first consider all the letters as distinct. Then there would be 7! ways. But since some letters are the same, we have to divide by the permutations of the identical letters. So for the two Es, if they were different, we would have 2! more permutations, but since they are the same, we divide by 2!. Similarly for the two Ls, divide by 2!. So that gives the same result.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it step by step. Let's say I want to arrange the 7 letters. First, choose positions for the Es. There are C(7,2) ways to choose positions for the two Es. Then, from the remaining 5 positions, choose positions for the two Ls, which is C(5,2).

Then 2! is 2, so 2! * 2! is 2 * 2 = 4. Then 5040 divided by 4 is 1260. So is the answer 1260? Hmm, but let me make sure I didn't miss any other duplicates. The letters in ELLIPSE are E, L, L, I, P, S, E. So E and L each have two, the rest are single. So yeah, that should be correct.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake in counting the letters. Let me list them again: E, L, L, I, P, S, E. So that's two Es, two Ls, and one each of I, P, S. So total letters: 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 7. Yep, that's right. So the formula is 7! divided by (number of duplicates factorial). Since there are two letters with duplicates, each duplicated twice, so 2! for E and 2! for L. So 7! / (2! * 2!) = 5040 / 4 = 1260.\n<end>\nBut let me verify this with another approach. Suppose I first consider all the letters as distinct. Then there would be 7! ways. But since some letters are the same, we have to divide by the permutations of the identical letters. So for the two Es, if they were different, we would have 2! more permutations, but since they are the same, we divide by 2!. Similarly for the two Ls, divide by 2!. So that gives the same result.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it step by step. Let's say I want to arrange the 7 letters. First, choose positions for the Es. There are C(7,2) ways to choose positions for the two Es. Then, from the remaining 5 positions, choose positions for the two Ls, which is C(5,2). Then, the remaining 3 letters (I, P, S) can be arranged in 3! ways. So total number of arrangements would be C(7,2) * C(5,2) * 3!.

So 7! / (2! * 2!) = 5040 / 4 = 1260.\n<end>\nBut let me verify this with another approach. Suppose I first consider all the letters as distinct. Then there would be 7! ways. But since some letters are the same, we have to divide by the permutations of the identical letters. So for the two Es, if they were different, we would have 2! more permutations, but since they are the same, we divide by 2!. Similarly for the two Ls, divide by 2!. So that gives the same result.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it step by step. Let's say I want to arrange the 7 letters. First, choose positions for the Es. There are C(7,2) ways to choose positions for the two Es. Then, from the remaining 5 positions, choose positions for the two Ls, which is C(5,2). Then, the remaining 3 letters (I, P, S) can be arranged in 3! ways. So total number of arrangements would be C(7,2) * C(5,2) * 3!.

The key was just substituting t = 2 into both equations and simplifying step by step. No calculus needed here, just substitution. Sometimes parametric equations can be tricky if you have to find derivatives or something, but this is straightforward substitution.
