Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\n### Step 2\nFirst off, since \\(z\\) is a complex number with \\(|z| = 4\\), I can represent \\(z\\) in polar form. Let's let \\(z = 4e^{i\\theta}\\), where \\(\\theta\\) is a real number. This is because the magnitude is 4, and the direction is arbitrary.\n\n### Step 3\nNow, plugging this into the expression, I get:\n\n### Step 4\n\\[\n(75 + 117i) \\cdot 4e^{i\\theta} + \\frac{96 + 144i}{4e^{i\\theta}}\n\\]\n\n### Step 5\nSimplifying this:\n\n### Step 6\n\\[\n4(75 + 117i)e^{i\\theta} + \\frac{96 + 144i}{4}e^{-i\\theta} = 4(75 + 117i)e^{i\\theta} + (24 + 36i)e^{-i\\theta}\n\\]\n\n### Step 7\nHmm, that seems a bit messy. Maybe there's a better way to approach this. Let's consider that \\(z\\) is on the circle of radius 4, so \\(z \\overline{z} = 16\\), where \\(\\overline{z}\\) is the complex conjugate of \\(z\\). Maybe that can help simplify the expression.\n\n### Step 8\nLet me try expressing \\(\\frac{1}{z}\\) in terms of \\(\\overline{z}\\):\n\n### Step 9\nSince \\(z \\overline{z} = 16\\), then \\(\\frac{1}{z} = \\frac{\\overline{z}}{16}\\).\n\n### Step 10\nSo, the expression becomes:\n\n### Step 11\n\\[\n(75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i) \\cdot \\frac{\\overline{z}}{16} = (75 + 117i)z + \\left(6 + 9i\\right)\\overline{z}\n\\]\n\n### Step 12\nThat's a bit cleaner. Now, let's let \\(z = a + bi\\), where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are real numbers, and \\(a^2 + b^2 = 16\\), since \\(|z| = 4\\).\n\n### Step 13\nThen, \\(\\overline{z} = a - bi\\).\n\n### Step 14\nPlugging these into the expression:\n\n### Step 15\n\\[\n(75 + 117i)(a + bi) + (6 + 9i)(a - bi)\n\\]\n\n### Step 16\nLet's expand both terms:\n\n### Step 17\nFirst term:\n\n### Step 18\n\\[\n(75 + 117i)(a + bi) = 75a + 75bi + 117ai + 117bi^2 = 75a + (75b + 117a)i + 117b(-1) = (75a - 117b) + (75b + 117a)i\n\\]\n\n### Step 19\nSecond term:\n\n### Step 20\n\\[\n(6 + 9i)(a - bi) = 6a - 6bi + 9ai - 9bi^2 = 6a + (9a - 6b)i - 9b(-1) = (6a + 9b) + (9a - 6b)i\n\\]\n\n### Step 21\nNow, add both terms together:\n\n### Step 22\n\\[\n(75a - 117b + 6a + 9b) + (75b + 117a + 9a - 6b)i = (81a - 108b) + (126a + 69b)i\n\\]\n\n### Step 23\nWe're interested in the real part, which is \\(81a - 108b\\). So, our objective is to maximize \\(81a - 108b\\) subject to \\(a^2 + b^2 = 16\\).\n\n### Step 24\nThis is a standard optimization problem with a constraint. We can use the method of Lagrange multipliers or consider it geometrically.\n\n### Step 25\nLet's consider it geometrically. The expression \\(81a - 108b\\) can be thought of as a dot product of the vectors \\((81, -108)\\) and \\((a, b)\\). Given that \\(a^2 + b^2 = 16\\), which is a circle of radius 4 centered at the origin.\n\n### Step 26\nThe maximum value of the dot product occurs when \\((a, b)\\) is in the same direction as \\((81, -108)\\). So, the maximum value is the magnitude of \\((81, -108)\\) times the magnitude of \\((a, b)\\), which is 4.\n\n### Step 27\nFirst, let's find the magnitude of \\((81, -108)\\):\n\n### Step 28\n\\[\n\\sqrt{81^2 + (-108)^2} = \\sqrt{6561 + 11664} = \\sqrt{18225} = 135\n\\]\n\n### Step 29\nTherefore, the maximum value of \\(81a - 108b\\) is \\(135 \\times 4 = 540\\).\n\n### Step 30\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. The magnitude of \\((81, -108)\\) is indeed \\(\\sqrt{81^2 + (-108)^2} = \\sqrt{6561 + 11664} = \\sqrt{18225} = 135\\). And since \\(a^2 + b^2 = 16\\), the maximum value of the dot product is \\(135 \\times 4 = 540\\).\n\n### Step 31\nBut let's confirm if this is achievable. That is, does there exist \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) with \\(a^2 + b^2 = 16\\) such that \\(81a - 108b = 540\\)?\n\n### Step 32\nLet's see. If \\((a, b)\\) is in the direction of \\((81, -108)\\), then we can write \\((a, b) = k(81, -108)\\), where \\(k\\) is a scalar.\n\n### Step 33\nGiven that \\(a^2 + b^2 = 16\\), we have:\n\n### Step 34\n\\[\nk^2(81^2 + (-108)^2) = 16\n\\]\n\n### Step 35\n\\[\nk^2(6561 + 11664) = 16\n\\]\n\n### Step 36\n\\[\nk^2(18225) = 16\n\\]\n\n### Step 37\n\\[\nk^2 = \\frac{16}{18225}\n\\]\n\n### Step 38\n\\[\nk = \\pm \\frac{4}{135}\n\\]\n\n### Step 39\nTaking the positive \\(k\\) for the maximum value:\n\n### Step 40\n\\[\n(a, b) = \\frac{4}{135}(81, -108) = \\left( \\frac{4 \\times 81}{135}, \\frac{4 \\times (-108)}{135} \\right) = \\left( \\frac{324}{135}, \\frac{-432}{135} \\right) = \\left( \\frac{36}{15}, \\frac{-48}{15} \\right) = \\left( \\frac{12}{5}, \\frac{-16}{5} \\right)\n\\]\n\n### Step 41\nNow, check if \\(a^2 + b^2 = 16\\):\n\n### Step 42\n\\[\n\\left( \\frac{12}{5} \\right)^2 + \\left( \\frac{-16}{5} \\right)^2 = \\frac{144}{25} + \\frac{256}{25} = \\frac{400}{25} = 16\n\\]\n\n### Step 43\nGood, it satisfies the constraint.

Enter your answer in the form $(r,\\\\theta),$ where $r > 0$ and $0 \\\\le \\\\theta < 2 \\\\pi.$'\n\"\"\"\n\nSolution:\n\"\"\"\n### STEP 1\nSo I have this problem here: convert the point (0,3) in rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates. I need to find the polar coordinates in the form (r, \u03b8), where r is greater than 0 and \u03b8 is between 0 and 2\u03c0. Alright, let's start by recalling how to convert from rectangular (Cartesian) coordinates to polar coordinates.\n\n### STEP 2\nI know that in polar coordinates, a point is defined by its distance from the origin (that's r) and the angle it makes with the positive x-axis (that's \u03b8). The formulas to convert from rectangular coordinates (x, y) to polar coordinates (r, \u03b8) are:\n\n### STEP 3\nr = \u221a(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)\n\n### STEP 4\n\u03b8 = arctan(y/x)\n\n### STEP 5\nBut I have to be careful with the angle \u03b8 because the arctan function only returns values between -\u03c0/2 and \u03c0/2, and I need to adjust it based on the quadrant in which the point lies to get the correct angle between 0 and 2\u03c0.\n\n### STEP 6\nGiven the point (0,3), let's identify x and y:\n\n### STEP 7\nx = 0\n\n### STEP 8\ny = 3\n\n### STEP 9\nFirst, let's find r:\n\n### STEP 10\nr = \u221a(0\u00b2 + 3\u00b2) = \u221a(0 + 9) = \u221a9 = 3\n\n### STEP 11\nSo, r = 3.\n\n### STEP 12\nNow, let's find \u03b8. The formula is \u03b8 = arctan(y/x), but in this case, x = 0, which would make the denominator zero. That means tan\u03b8 is undefined, which happens at angles where \u03b8 is \u03c0/2 or 3\u03c0/2.\n\n### STEP 13\nLooking at the point (0,3), it's located on the positive y-axis. So, the angle from the positive x-axis to the positive y-axis is \u03c0/2 radians (90 degrees).\n\n### STEP 14\nTherefore, \u03b8 = \u03c0/2.\n\n### STEP 15\nSo, the polar coordinates should be (3, \u03c0/2).\n\n### STEP 16\nBut just to double-check, let's consider the conditions for \u03b8. Since the point is on the positive y-axis, and the arctan function would normally return -\u03c0/2 or \u03c0/2, but in this case, because x is 0 and y is positive, \u03b8 is indeed \u03c0/2.\n\n### STEP 17\nAlso, since r is positive and \u03b8 is between 0 and 2\u03c0, this satisfies the requirements.\n\n### STEP 18\nTherefore, the polar coordinates are (3, \u03c0/2).\n\n### STEP 19\n**Final Answer**\n\n### STEP 20\n\\[ \\boxed{\\left(3,\\,\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)} \\]\n\"\"\"\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Explanation:\n\nSolution Analysis: We will begin by examining the steps that explicitly contain the answer.

Now, let's let \\(z = a + bi\\), where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are real numbers, and \\(a^2 + b^2 = 16\\), since \\(|z| = 4\\).\n\n### Step 13\nThen, \\(\\overline{z} = a - bi\\).\n\n### Step 14\nPlugging these into the expression:\n\n### Step 15\n\\[\n(75 + 117i)(a + bi) + (6 + 9i)(a - bi)\n\\]\n\n### Step 16\nLet's expand both terms:\n\n### Step 17\nFirst term:\n\n### Step 18\n\\[\n(75 + 117i)(a + bi) = 75a + 75bi + 117ai + 117bi^2 = 75a + (75b + 117a)i + 117b(-1) = (75a - 117b) + (75b + 117a)i\n\\]\n\n### Step 19\nSecond term:\n\n### Step 20\n\\[\n(6 + 9i)(a - bi) = 6a - 6bi + 9ai - 9bi^2 = 6a + (9a - 6b)i - 9b(-1) = (6a + 9b) + (9a - 6b)i\n\\]\n\n### Step 21\nNow, add both terms together:\n\n### Step 22\n\\[\n(75a - 117b + 6a + 9b) + (75b + 117a + 9a - 6b)i = (81a - 108b) + (126a + 69b)i\n\\]\n\n### Step 23\nWe're interested in the real part, which is \\(81a - 108b\\). So, our objective is to maximize \\(81a - 108b\\) subject to \\(a^2 + b^2 = 16\\).\n\n### Step 24\nThis is a standard optimization problem with a constraint. We can use the method of Lagrange multipliers or consider it geometrically.\n\n### Step 25\nLet's consider it geometrically. The expression \\(81a - 108b\\) can be thought of as a dot product of the vectors \\((81, -108)\\) and \\((a, b)\\). Given that \\(a^2 + b^2 = 16\\), which is a circle of radius 4 centered at the origin.\n\n### Step 26\nThe maximum value of the dot product occurs when \\((a, b)\\) is in the same direction as \\((81, -108)\\). So, the maximum value is the magnitude of \\((81, -108)\\) times the magnitude of \\((a, b)\\), which is 4.\n\n### Step 27\nFirst, let's find the magnitude of \\((81, -108)\\):\n\n### Step 28\n\\[\n\\sqrt{81^2 + (-108)^2} = \\sqrt{6561 + 11664} = \\sqrt{18225} = 135\n\\]\n\n### Step 29\nTherefore, the maximum value of \\(81a - 108b\\) is \\(135 \\times 4 = 540\\).\n\n### Step 30\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. The magnitude of \\((81, -108)\\) is indeed \\(\\sqrt{81^2 + (-108)^2} = \\sqrt{6561 + 11664} = \\sqrt{18225} = 135\\). And since \\(a^2 + b^2 = 16\\), the maximum value of the dot product is \\(135 \\times 4 = 540\\).\n\n### Step 31\nBut let's confirm if this is achievable. That is, does there exist \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) with \\(a^2 + b^2 = 16\\) such that \\(81a - 108b = 540\\)?\n\n### Step 32\nLet's see. If \\((a, b)\\) is in the direction of \\((81, -108)\\), then we can write \\((a, b) = k(81, -108)\\), where \\(k\\) is a scalar.\n\n### Step 33\nGiven that \\(a^2 + b^2 = 16\\), we have:\n\n### Step 34\n\\[\nk^2(81^2 + (-108)^2) = 16\n\\]\n\n### Step 35\n\\[\nk^2(6561 + 11664) = 16\n\\]\n\n### Step 36\n\\[\nk^2(18225) = 16\n\\]\n\n### Step 37\n\\[\nk^2 = \\frac{16}{18225}\n\\]\n\n### Step 38\n\\[\nk = \\pm \\frac{4}{135}\n\\]\n\n### Step 39\nTaking the positive \\(k\\) for the maximum value:\n\n### Step 40\n\\[\n(a, b) = \\frac{4}{135}(81, -108) = \\left( \\frac{4 \\times 81}{135}, \\frac{4 \\times (-108)}{135} \\right) = \\left( \\frac{324}{135}, \\frac{-432}{135} \\right) = \\left( \\frac{36}{15}, \\frac{-48}{15} \\right) = \\left( \\frac{12}{5}, \\frac{-16}{5} \\right)\n\\]\n\n### Step 41\nNow, check if \\(a^2 + b^2 = 16\\):\n\n### Step 42\n\\[\n\\left( \\frac{12}{5} \\right)^2 + \\left( \\frac{-16}{5} \\right)^2 = \\frac{144}{25} + \\frac{256}{25} = \\frac{400}{25} = 16\n\\]\n\n### Step 43\nGood, it satisfies the constraint.

Enter your answer in the form $(r,\\\\theta),$ where $r > 0$ and $0 \\\\le \\\\theta < 2 \\\\pi.$'\n\"\"\"\n\nSolution:\n\"\"\"\n### STEP 1\nSo I have this problem here: convert the point (0,3) in rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates. I need to find the polar coordinates in the form (r, \u03b8), where r is greater than 0 and \u03b8 is between 0 and 2\u03c0. Alright, let's start by recalling how to convert from rectangular (Cartesian) coordinates to polar coordinates.\n\n### STEP 2\nI know that in polar coordinates, a point is defined by its distance from the origin (that's r) and the angle it makes with the positive x-axis (that's \u03b8). The formulas to convert from rectangular coordinates (x, y) to polar coordinates (r, \u03b8) are:\n\n### STEP 3\nr = \u221a(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)\n\n### STEP 4\n\u03b8 = arctan(y/x)\n\n### STEP 5\nBut I have to be careful with the angle \u03b8 because the arctan function only returns values between -\u03c0/2 and \u03c0/2, and I need to adjust it based on the quadrant in which the point lies to get the correct angle between 0 and 2\u03c0.\n\n### STEP 6\nGiven the point (0,3), let's identify x and y:\n\n### STEP 7\nx = 0\n\n### STEP 8\ny = 3\n\n### STEP 9\nFirst, let's find r:\n\n### STEP 10\nr = \u221a(0\u00b2 + 3\u00b2) = \u221a(0 + 9) = \u221a9 = 3\n\n### STEP 11\nSo, r = 3.\n\n### STEP 12\nNow, let's find \u03b8. The formula is \u03b8 = arctan(y/x), but in this case, x = 0, which would make the denominator zero. That means tan\u03b8 is undefined, which happens at angles where \u03b8 is \u03c0/2 or 3\u03c0/2.\n\n### STEP 13\nLooking at the point (0,3), it's located on the positive y-axis. So, the angle from the positive x-axis to the positive y-axis is \u03c0/2 radians (90 degrees).\n\n### STEP 14\nTherefore, \u03b8 = \u03c0/2.\n\n### STEP 15\nSo, the polar coordinates should be (3, \u03c0/2).\n\n### STEP 16\nBut just to double-check, let's consider the conditions for \u03b8. Since the point is on the positive y-axis, and the arctan function would normally return -\u03c0/2 or \u03c0/2, but in this case, because x is 0 and y is positive, \u03b8 is indeed \u03c0/2.\n\n### STEP 17\nAlso, since r is positive and \u03b8 is between 0 and 2\u03c0, this satisfies the requirements.\n\n### STEP 18\nTherefore, the polar coordinates are (3, \u03c0/2).\n\n### STEP 19\n**Final Answer**\n\n### STEP 20\n\\[ \\boxed{\\left(3,\\,\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)} \\]\n\"\"\"\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Explanation:\n\nSolution Analysis: We will begin by examining the steps that explicitly contain the answer.

The magnitude of \\((81, -108)\\) is indeed \\(\\sqrt{81^2 + (-108)^2} = \\sqrt{6561 + 11664} = \\sqrt{18225} = 135\\). And since \\(a^2 + b^2 = 16\\), the maximum value of the dot product is \\(135 \\times 4 = 540\\).\n\n### Step 31\nBut let's confirm if this is achievable. That is, does there exist \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) with \\(a^2 + b^2 = 16\\) such that \\(81a - 108b = 540\\)?\n\n### Step 32\nLet's see.

Enter your answer in the form $(r,\\\\theta),$ where $r > 0$ and $0 \\\\le \\\\theta < 2 \\\\pi.$'\n\"\"\"\n\nSolution:\n\"\"\"\n### STEP 1\nSo I have this problem here: convert the point (0,3) in rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates. I need to find the polar coordinates in the form (r, \u03b8), where r is greater than 0 and \u03b8 is between 0 and 2\u03c0. Alright, let's start by recalling how to convert from rectangular (Cartesian) coordinates to polar coordinates.\n\n### STEP 2\nI know that in polar coordinates, a point is defined by its distance from the origin (that's r) and the angle it makes with the positive x-axis (that's \u03b8). The formulas to convert from rectangular coordinates (x, y) to polar coordinates (r, \u03b8) are:\n\n### STEP 3\nr = \u221a(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)\n\n### STEP 4\n\u03b8 = arctan(y/x)\n\n### STEP 5\nBut I have to be careful with the angle \u03b8 because the arctan function only returns values between -\u03c0/2 and \u03c0/2, and I need to adjust it based on the quadrant in which the point lies to get the correct angle between 0 and 2\u03c0.\n\n### STEP 6\nGiven the point (0,3), let's identify x and y:\n\n### STEP 7\nx = 0\n\n### STEP 8\ny = 3\n\n### STEP 9\nFirst, let's find r:\n\n### STEP 10\nr = \u221a(0\u00b2 + 3\u00b2) = \u221a(0 + 9) = \u221a9 = 3\n\n### STEP 11\nSo, r = 3.\n\n### STEP 12\nNow, let's find \u03b8. The formula is \u03b8 = arctan(y/x), but in this case, x = 0, which would make the denominator zero. That means tan\u03b8 is undefined, which happens at angles where \u03b8 is \u03c0/2 or 3\u03c0/2.\n\n### STEP 13\nLooking at the point (0,3), it's located on the positive y-axis. So, the angle from the positive x-axis to the positive y-axis is \u03c0/2 radians (90 degrees).\n\n### STEP 14\nTherefore, \u03b8 = \u03c0/2.\n\n### STEP 15\nSo, the polar coordinates should be (3, \u03c0/2).\n\n### STEP 16\nBut just to double-check, let's consider the conditions for \u03b8. Since the point is on the positive y-axis, and the arctan function would normally return -\u03c0/2 or \u03c0/2, but in this case, because x is 0 and y is positive, \u03b8 is indeed \u03c0/2.\n\n### STEP 17\nAlso, since r is positive and \u03b8 is between 0 and 2\u03c0, this satisfies the requirements.\n\n### STEP 18\nTherefore, the polar coordinates are (3, \u03c0/2).\n\n### STEP 19\n**Final Answer**\n\n### STEP 20\n\\[ \\boxed{\\left(3,\\,\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)} \\]\n\"\"\"\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Explanation:\n\nSolution Analysis: We will begin by examining the steps that explicitly contain the answer.

The torus is created by revolving a circle with radius 3 around an axis that's 6 units away from the center of the circle, kind of like a donut shape. The sphere has a radius of 11. The problem mentions that when the torus rests on the outside of the sphere, it's externally tangent along a circle with radius \\(r_i\\), and in another position, it's externally tangent along a circle with radius \\(r_o\\). I need to find \\(r_i - r_o\\) in the form \\(\\frac{m}{n}\\), where \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) are relatively prime positive integers, and then find \\(m + n\\).\n\n###STEP 2\nFirst, I need to understand the geometry of the situation. A torus is generated by rotating a circle in three-dimensional space about an axis coplanar with the circle. In this case, the circle has a radius of 3, and the axis is 6 units away from the center of the circle. So, the distance from the center of the torus (which is the center of the axis of rotation) to the center of the tube (the original circle) is 6 units, and the radius of the tube is 3 units.\n\n###STEP 3\nThe sphere has a radius of 11. The torus is resting on the outside of the sphere and is externally tangent to it along a circle. There are two such positions, corresponding to \\(r_i\\) and \\(r_o\\), and I need to find the difference between these two radii.\n\n###STEP 4\nTo visualize this, imagine the torus sitting on the sphere, like a donut on top of a large ball. The point of tangency is a circle, and there are two possible orientations for this setup, hence two different radii \\(r_i\\) and \\(r_o\\).\n\n###STEP 5\nI need to find expressions for \\(r_i\\) and \\(r_o\\). To do that, I should consider the geometry of the torus and the sphere and how they interact when tangent to each other.\n\n###STEP 6\nFirst, let's recall some properties of a torus. The torus has two important radii: the major radius \\(R\\), which is the distance from the center of the torus to the center of the tube, and the minor radius \\(r\\), which is the radius of the tube itself. In this problem, \\(R = 6\\) and \\(r = 3\\).\n\n###STEP 7\nThe sphere has a radius \\(S = 11\\).\n\n###STEP 8\nWhen the torus is externally tangent to the sphere along a circle, the centers of the sphere and the torus are separated by a certain distance, and the point of tangency is a circle that lies in a plane perpendicular to the line connecting the centers of the sphere and the torus.\n\n###STEP 9\nLet's denote the center of the sphere as \\(O\\), and the center of the torus as \\(C\\). The distance between \\(O\\) and \\(C\\) is \\(OC\\).\n\n###STEP 10\nIn the case of external tangency, the distance between the centers \\(OC\\) should be equal to the sum of the sphere's radius and the torus's major radius plus the minor radius, but I need to be careful here.\n\n###STEP 11\nActually, for a torus and a sphere to be externally tangent, the distance between their centers should be equal to the sum of their radii in a specific way. I need to think about this more carefully.\n\n###STEP 12\nPerhaps it's better to consider the cross-section of the setup. If I take a cross-section containing the centers of the sphere and the torus, I can analyze the geometry in two dimensions.\n\n###STEP 13\nIn the cross-section, the sphere appears as a circle with radius 11, and the torus appears as two circles: one with radius 3 (the tube) around a point that is 6 units away from the center of the torus.\n\n###STEP 14\nWait, actually, in a cross-section of the torus containing its axis of rotation, the torus appears as two circles: one with radius \\(R + r = 6 + 3 = 9\\) and one with radius \\(R - r = 6 - 3 = 3\\).\n\n###STEP 15\nSo, in the cross-section, the torus is represented by two concentric circles with radii 3 and 9, centered at \\(C\\), and the sphere is represented by a circle with radius 11 centered at \\(O\\).\n\n###STEP 16\nWhen the torus is externally tangent to the sphere, the point of tangency is a circle that lies in a plane perpendicular to \\(OC\\), and its radius can be found using the geometry of the cross-section.\n\n###STEP 17\nI need to find the radius of this circle of tangency, which I believe is related to the angular separation in the cross-section.\n\n###STEP 18\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the concept of the pitch circle in gear theory or consider the torus as a surface of revolution and find the radius of the circle of intersection with the sphere.\n\n###STEP 19\nLet me try to find the distance \\(OC\\) between the centers of the sphere and the torus when they are externally tangent.\n\n###STEP 20\nIn the case of external tangency, the distance between the centers should be equal to the sum of their \"effective\" radii. But I need to be precise about what that means for a torus.\n\n###STEP 21\nI recall that for two surfaces to be externally tangent, the distance between their centers should be equal to the sum of their radii, but for a torus, it's a bit more complicated because it has two radii: the major and minor radii.\n\n###STEP 22\nPerhaps I should consider the maximum and minimum distances from the center of the torus to the surface of the torus.\n\n###STEP 23\nThe maximum distance from the center of the torus to its surface is \\(R + r = 6 + 3 = 9\\), and the minimum distance is \\(R - r = 6 - 3 = 3\\).\n\n###STEP 24\nSimilarly, the sphere has a constant radius of 11.\n\n###STEP 25\nWhen the torus is externally tangent to the sphere, the distance between their centers \\(OC\\) should be equal to the sum of the sphere's radius and the maximum distance from the torus's center to its surface, which is \\(11 + 9 = 20\\).\n\n###STEP 26\nAlternatively, perhaps it's the sum of the sphere's radius and the minor radius of the torus, but I'm not sure.\n\n###STEP 27\nWait, maybe I need to consider the principle of addition of radii for external tangency.\n\n###STEP 28\nIf the torus is externally tangent to the sphere, the distance between their centers should be equal to the sum of the sphere's radius and the torus's major radius, but I need to account for the minor radius as well.\n\n###STEP 29\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the sphere's radius plus the torus's minor radius.\n\n###STEP 30\nThis is confusing. Maybe I should look for a formula or a geometric property that relates the radii of a torus and a sphere when they are tangent.\n\n###STEP 31\nLet me try to think differently. Suppose I consider a point on the surface of the torus that is tangent to the sphere. The distance from the center of the sphere to this point is equal to the sphere's radius, which is 11.\n\n###STEP 32\nSimilarly, the distance from the center of the torus to this point is equal to the major radius plus or minus the minor radius, depending on the position.\n\n###STEP 33\nWait, more precisely, the position vector of a point on the torus can be expressed in terms of the major and minor radii.\n\n###STEP 34\nIn general, the parametric equations for a torus are:\n\n###STEP 35\n\\( x = (R + r \\cos v) \\cos u \\)\n\n###STEP 36\n\\( y = (R + r \\cos v) \\sin u \\)\n\n###STEP 37\n\\( z = r \\sin v \\)\n\n###STEP 38\nWhere \\(u\\) and \\(v\\) are angular parameters.\n\n###STEP 39\nBut I'm not sure if this will help me directly here.\n\n###STEP 40\nMaybe I should consider the fact that the torus is tangent to the sphere, which means that at the point of tangency, their surfaces touch but do not intersect, and their normal vectors are aligned.\n\n###STEP 41\nThis seems a bit too involved for my current level. Perhaps there's a simpler way to approach this problem.\n\n###STEP 42\nLet me consider the two extreme positions of the torus resting on the sphere: one where the torus is as close as possible to the sphere (corresponding to \\(r_i\\)), and one where it's as far as possible (corresponding to \\(r_o\\)).\n\n###STEP 43\nIn these positions, the torus is tangent to the sphere along a circle, and I need to find the radii of these circles.\n\n###STEP 44\nPerhaps I can use the concept of the circle of intersection between the torus and the sphere.\n\n###STEP 45\nThe general equation for a torus and a sphere can be set up in coordinates, and then I can find the conditions for them to be tangent along a circle.\n\n###STEP 46\nBut this seems quite algebraically intensive, and I'm not sure if that's the best approach.\n\n###STEP 47\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider the angular positions and use trigonometric relationships to find the radii \\(r_i\\) and \\(r_o\\).\n\n###STEP 48\nLet me try to sketch a diagram to visualize this better.\n\n###STEP 49\nImagine the sphere centered at the origin, and the torus centered at some point away from the origin.

Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\n### Step 2\nFirst off, since \\(z\\) is a complex number with \\(|z| = 4\\), I can represent \\(z\\) in polar form. Let's let \\(z = 4e^{i\\theta}\\), where \\(\\theta\\) is a real number. This is because the magnitude is 4, and the direction is arbitrary.\n\n### Step 3\nNow, plugging this into the expression, I get:\n\n### Step 4\n\\[\n(75 + 117i) \\cdot 4e^{i\\theta} + \\frac{96 + 144i}{4e^{i\\theta}}\n\\]\n\n### Step 5\nSimplifying this:\n\n### Step 6\n\\[\n4(75 + 117i)e^{i\\theta} + \\frac{96 + 144i}{4}e^{-i\\theta} = 4(75 + 117i)e^{i\\theta} + (24 + 36i)e^{-i\\theta}\n\\]\n\n### Step 7\nHmm, that seems a bit messy. Maybe there's a better way to approach this. Let's consider that \\(z\\) is on the circle of radius 4, so \\(z \\overline{z} = 16\\), where \\(\\overline{z}\\) is the complex conjugate of \\(z\\). Maybe that can help simplify the expression.\n\n### Step 8\nLet me try expressing \\(\\frac{1}{z}\\) in terms of \\(\\overline{z}\\):\n\n### Step 9\nSince \\(z \\overline{z} = 16\\), then \\(\\frac{1}{z} = \\frac{\\overline{z}}{16}\\).\n\n### Step 10\nSo, the expression becomes:\n\n### Step 11\n\\[\n(75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i) \\cdot \\frac{\\overline{z}}{16} = (75 + 117i)z + \\left(6 + 9i\\right)\\overline{z}\n\\]\n\n### Step 12\nThat's a bit cleaner.

So, our objective is to maximize \\(81a - 108b\\) subject to \\(a^2 + b^2 = 16\\).\n\n### Step 24\nThis is a standard optimization problem with a constraint. We can use the method of Lagrange multipliers or consider it geometrically.\n\n### Step 25\nLet's consider it geometrically. The expression \\(81a - 108b\\) can be thought of as a dot product of the vectors \\((81, -108)\\) and \\((a, b)\\). Given that \\(a^2 + b^2 = 16\\), which is a circle of radius 4 centered at the origin.\n\n### Step 26\nThe maximum value of the dot product occurs when \\((a, b)\\) is in the same direction as \\((81, -108)\\). So, the maximum value is the magnitude of \\((81, -108)\\) times the magnitude of \\((a, b)\\), which is 4.\n\n### Step 27\nFirst, let's find the magnitude of \\((81, -108)\\):\n\n### Step 28\n\\[\n\\sqrt{81^2 + (-108)^2} = \\sqrt{6561 + 11664} = \\sqrt{18225} = 135\n\\]\n\n### Step 29\nTherefore, the maximum value of \\(81a - 108b\\) is \\(135 \\times 4 = 540\\).\n\n### Step 30\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. The magnitude of \\((81, -108)\\) is indeed \\(\\sqrt{81^2 + (-108)^2} = \\sqrt{6561 + 11664} = \\sqrt{18225} = 135\\). And since \\(a^2 + b^2 = 16\\), the maximum value of the dot product is \\(135 \\times 4 = 540\\).\n\n### Step 31\nBut let's confirm if this is achievable. That is, does there exist \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) with \\(a^2 + b^2 = 16\\) such that \\(81a - 108b = 540\\)?\n\n### Step 32\nLet's see. If \\((a, b)\\) is in the direction of \\((81, -108)\\), then we can write \\((a, b) = k(81, -108)\\), where \\(k\\) is a scalar.\n\n### Step 33\nGiven that \\(a^2 + b^2 = 16\\), we have:\n\n### Step 34\n\\[\nk^2(81^2 + (-108)^2) = 16\n\\]\n\n### Step 35\n\\[\nk^2(6561 + 11664) = 16\n\\]\n\n### Step 36\n\\[\nk^2(18225) = 16\n\\]\n\n### Step 37\n\\[\nk^2 = \\frac{16}{18225}\n\\]\n\n### Step 38\n\\[\nk = \\pm \\frac{4}{135}\n\\]\n\n### Step 39\nTaking the positive \\(k\\) for the maximum value:\n\n### Step 40\n\\[\n(a, b) = \\frac{4}{135}(81, -108) = \\left( \\frac{4 \\times 81}{135}, \\frac{4 \\times (-108)}{135} \\right) = \\left( \\frac{324}{135}, \\frac{-432}{135} \\right) = \\left( \\frac{36}{15}, \\frac{-48}{15} \\right) = \\left( \\frac{12}{5}, \\frac{-16}{5} \\right)\n\\]\n\n### Step 41\nNow, check if \\(a^2 + b^2 = 16\\):\n\n### Step 42\n\\[\n\\left( \\frac{12}{5} \\right)^2 + \\left( \\frac{-16}{5} \\right)^2 = \\frac{144}{25} + \\frac{256}{25} = \\frac{400}{25} = 16\n\\]\n\n### Step 43\nGood, it satisfies the constraint.

Enter your answer in the form $(r,\\\\theta),$ where $r > 0$ and $0 \\\\le \\\\theta < 2 \\\\pi.$'\n\"\"\"\n\nSolution:\n\"\"\"\n### STEP 1\nSo I have this problem here: convert the point (0,3) in rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates. I need to find the polar coordinates in the form (r, \u03b8), where r is greater than 0 and \u03b8 is between 0 and 2\u03c0. Alright, let's start by recalling how to convert from rectangular (Cartesian) coordinates to polar coordinates.\n\n### STEP 2\nI know that in polar coordinates, a point is defined by its distance from the origin (that's r) and the angle it makes with the positive x-axis (that's \u03b8). The formulas to convert from rectangular coordinates (x, y) to polar coordinates (r, \u03b8) are:\n\n### STEP 3\nr = \u221a(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)\n\n### STEP 4\n\u03b8 = arctan(y/x)\n\n### STEP 5\nBut I have to be careful with the angle \u03b8 because the arctan function only returns values between -\u03c0/2 and \u03c0/2, and I need to adjust it based on the quadrant in which the point lies to get the correct angle between 0 and 2\u03c0.\n\n### STEP 6\nGiven the point (0,3), let's identify x and y:\n\n### STEP 7\nx = 0\n\n### STEP 8\ny = 3\n\n### STEP 9\nFirst, let's find r:\n\n### STEP 10\nr = \u221a(0\u00b2 + 3\u00b2) = \u221a(0 + 9) = \u221a9 = 3\n\n### STEP 11\nSo, r = 3.\n\n### STEP 12\nNow, let's find \u03b8. The formula is \u03b8 = arctan(y/x), but in this case, x = 0, which would make the denominator zero. That means tan\u03b8 is undefined, which happens at angles where \u03b8 is \u03c0/2 or 3\u03c0/2.\n\n### STEP 13\nLooking at the point (0,3), it's located on the positive y-axis. So, the angle from the positive x-axis to the positive y-axis is \u03c0/2 radians (90 degrees).\n\n### STEP 14\nTherefore, \u03b8 = \u03c0/2.\n\n### STEP 15\nSo, the polar coordinates should be (3, \u03c0/2).\n\n### STEP 16\nBut just to double-check, let's consider the conditions for \u03b8. Since the point is on the positive y-axis, and the arctan function would normally return -\u03c0/2 or \u03c0/2, but in this case, because x is 0 and y is positive, \u03b8 is indeed \u03c0/2.\n\n### STEP 17\nAlso, since r is positive and \u03b8 is between 0 and 2\u03c0, this satisfies the requirements.\n\n### STEP 18\nTherefore, the polar coordinates are (3, \u03c0/2).\n\n### STEP 19\n**Final Answer**\n\n### STEP 20\n\\[ \\boxed{\\left(3,\\,\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)} \\]\n\"\"\"\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Explanation:\n\nSolution Analysis: We will begin by examining the steps that explicitly contain the answer.

Given that \\(a^2 + b^2 = 16\\), which is a circle of radius 4 centered at the origin.\n\n### Step 26\nThe maximum value of the dot product occurs when \\((a, b)\\) is in the same direction as \\((81, -108)\\). So, the maximum value is the magnitude of \\((81, -108)\\) times the magnitude of \\((a, b)\\), which is 4.\n\n### Step 27\nFirst, let's find the magnitude of \\((81, -108)\\):\n\n### Step 28\n\\[\n\\sqrt{81^2 + (-108)^2} = \\sqrt{6561 + 11664} = \\sqrt{18225} = 135\n\\]\n\n### Step 29\nTherefore, the maximum value of \\(81a - 108b\\) is \\(135 \\times 4 = 540\\).\n\n### Step 30\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. The magnitude of \\((81, -108)\\) is indeed \\(\\sqrt{81^2 + (-108)^2} = \\sqrt{6561 + 11664} = \\sqrt{18225} = 135\\). And since \\(a^2 + b^2 = 16\\), the maximum value of the dot product is \\(135 \\times 4 = 540\\).\n\n### Step 31\nBut let's confirm if this is achievable. That is, does there exist \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) with \\(a^2 + b^2 = 16\\) such that \\(81a - 108b = 540\\)?\n\n### Step 32\nLet's see. If \\((a, b)\\) is in the direction of \\((81, -108)\\), then we can write \\((a, b) = k(81, -108)\\), where \\(k\\) is a scalar.\n\n### Step 33\nGiven that \\(a^2 + b^2 = 16\\), we have:\n\n### Step 34\n\\[\nk^2(81^2 + (-108)^2) = 16\n\\]\n\n### Step 35\n\\[\nk^2(6561 + 11664) = 16\n\\]\n\n### Step 36\n\\[\nk^2(18225) = 16\n\\]\n\n### Step 37\n\\[\nk^2 = \\frac{16}{18225}\n\\]\n\n### Step 38\n\\[\nk = \\pm \\frac{4}{135}\n\\]\n\n### Step 39\nTaking the positive \\(k\\) for the maximum value:\n\n### Step 40\n\\[\n(a, b) = \\frac{4}{135}(81, -108) = \\left( \\frac{4 \\times 81}{135}, \\frac{4 \\times (-108)}{135} \\right) = \\left( \\frac{324}{135}, \\frac{-432}{135} \\right) = \\left( \\frac{36}{15}, \\frac{-48}{15} \\right) = \\left( \\frac{12}{5}, \\frac{-16}{5} \\right)\n\\]\n\n### Step 41\nNow, check if \\(a^2 + b^2 = 16\\):\n\n### Step 42\n\\[\n\\left( \\frac{12}{5} \\right)^2 + \\left( \\frac{-16}{5} \\right)^2 = \\frac{144}{25} + \\frac{256}{25} = \\frac{400}{25} = 16\n\\]\n\n### Step 43\nGood, it satisfies the constraint. Now, compute \\(81a - 108b\\):\n\"\"\"\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Explanation:\n\nSolution Analysis: To begin, we will examine the steps that yield the solution.

Enter your answer in the form $(r,\\\\theta),$ where $r > 0$ and $0 \\\\le \\\\theta < 2 \\\\pi.$'\n\"\"\"\n\nSolution:\n\"\"\"\n### STEP 1\nSo I have this problem here: convert the point (0,3) in rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates. I need to find the polar coordinates in the form (r, \u03b8), where r is greater than 0 and \u03b8 is between 0 and 2\u03c0. Alright, let's start by recalling how to convert from rectangular (Cartesian) coordinates to polar coordinates.\n\n### STEP 2\nI know that in polar coordinates, a point is defined by its distance from the origin (that's r) and the angle it makes with the positive x-axis (that's \u03b8). The formulas to convert from rectangular coordinates (x, y) to polar coordinates (r, \u03b8) are:\n\n### STEP 3\nr = \u221a(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)\n\n### STEP 4\n\u03b8 = arctan(y/x)\n\n### STEP 5\nBut I have to be careful with the angle \u03b8 because the arctan function only returns values between -\u03c0/2 and \u03c0/2, and I need to adjust it based on the quadrant in which the point lies to get the correct angle between 0 and 2\u03c0.\n\n### STEP 6\nGiven the point (0,3), let's identify x and y:\n\n### STEP 7\nx = 0\n\n### STEP 8\ny = 3\n\n### STEP 9\nFirst, let's find r:\n\n### STEP 10\nr = \u221a(0\u00b2 + 3\u00b2) = \u221a(0 + 9) = \u221a9 = 3\n\n### STEP 11\nSo, r = 3.\n\n### STEP 12\nNow, let's find \u03b8. The formula is \u03b8 = arctan(y/x), but in this case, x = 0, which would make the denominator zero. That means tan\u03b8 is undefined, which happens at angles where \u03b8 is \u03c0/2 or 3\u03c0/2.\n\n### STEP 13\nLooking at the point (0,3), it's located on the positive y-axis. So, the angle from the positive x-axis to the positive y-axis is \u03c0/2 radians (90 degrees).\n\n### STEP 14\nTherefore, \u03b8 = \u03c0/2.\n\n### STEP 15\nSo, the polar coordinates should be (3, \u03c0/2).\n\n### STEP 16\nBut just to double-check, let's consider the conditions for \u03b8. Since the point is on the positive y-axis, and the arctan function would normally return -\u03c0/2 or \u03c0/2, but in this case, because x is 0 and y is positive, \u03b8 is indeed \u03c0/2.\n\n### STEP 17\nAlso, since r is positive and \u03b8 is between 0 and 2\u03c0, this satisfies the requirements.\n\n### STEP 18\nTherefore, the polar coordinates are (3, \u03c0/2).\n\n### STEP 19\n**Final Answer**\n\n### STEP 20\n\\[ \\boxed{\\left(3,\\,\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)} \\]\n\"\"\"\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Explanation:\n\nSolution Analysis: We will begin by examining the steps that explicitly contain the answer.

Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\n### Step 2\nFirst off, since \\(z\\) is a complex number with \\(|z| = 4\\), I can represent \\(z\\) in polar form. Let's let \\(z = 4e^{i\\theta}\\), where \\(\\theta\\) is a real number. This is because the magnitude is 4, and the direction is arbitrary.\n\n### Step 3\nNow, plugging this into the expression, I get:\n\n### Step 4\n\\[\n(75 + 117i) \\cdot 4e^{i\\theta} + \\frac{96 + 144i}{4e^{i\\theta}}\n\\]\n\n### Step 5\nSimplifying this:\n\n### Step 6\n\\[\n4(75 + 117i)e^{i\\theta} + \\frac{96 + 144i}{4}e^{-i\\theta} = 4(75 + 117i)e^{i\\theta} + (24 + 36i)e^{-i\\theta}\n\\]\n\n### Step 7\nHmm, that seems a bit messy. Maybe there's a better way to approach this. Let's consider that \\(z\\) is on the circle of radius 4, so \\(z \\overline{z} = 16\\), where \\(\\overline{z}\\) is the complex conjugate of \\(z\\). Maybe that can help simplify the expression.\n\n### Step 8\nLet me try expressing \\(\\frac{1}{z}\\) in terms of \\(\\overline{z}\\):\n\n### Step 9\nSince \\(z \\overline{z} = 16\\), then \\(\\frac{1}{z} = \\frac{\\overline{z}}{16}\\).\n\n### Step 10\nSo, the expression becomes:\n\n### Step 11\n\\[\n(75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i) \\cdot \\frac{\\overline{z}}{16} = (75 + 117i)z + \\left(6 + 9i\\right)\\overline{z}\n\\]\n\n### Step 12\nThat's a bit cleaner.

So, our objective is to maximize \\(81a - 108b\\) subject to \\(a^2 + b^2 = 16\\).\n\n### Step 24\nThis is a standard optimization problem with a constraint. We can use the method of Lagrange multipliers or consider it geometrically.\n\n### Step 25\nLet's consider it geometrically. The expression \\(81a - 108b\\) can be thought of as a dot product of the vectors \\((81, -108)\\) and \\((a, b)\\). Given that \\(a^2 + b^2 = 16\\), which is a circle of radius 4 centered at the origin.\n\n### Step 26\nThe maximum value of the dot product occurs when \\((a, b)\\) is in the same direction as \\((81, -108)\\). So, the maximum value is the magnitude of \\((81, -108)\\) times the magnitude of \\((a, b)\\), which is 4.\n\n### Step 27\nFirst, let's find the magnitude of \\((81, -108)\\):\n\n### Step 28\n\\[\n\\sqrt{81^2 + (-108)^2} = \\sqrt{6561 + 11664} = \\sqrt{18225} = 135\n\\]\n\n### Step 29\nTherefore, the maximum value of \\(81a - 108b\\) is \\(135 \\times 4 = 540\\).\n\n### Step 30\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. The magnitude of \\((81, -108)\\) is indeed \\(\\sqrt{81^2 + (-108)^2} = \\sqrt{6561 + 11664} = \\sqrt{18225} = 135\\). And since \\(a^2 + b^2 = 16\\), the maximum value of the dot product is \\(135 \\times 4 = 540\\).\n\n### Step 31\nBut let's confirm if this is achievable. That is, does there exist \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) with \\(a^2 + b^2 = 16\\) such that \\(81a - 108b = 540\\)?\n\n### Step 32\nLet's see. If \\((a, b)\\) is in the direction of \\((81, -108)\\), then we can write \\((a, b) = k(81, -108)\\), where \\(k\\) is a scalar.\n\n### Step 33\nGiven that \\(a^2 + b^2 = 16\\), we have:\n\n### Step 34\n\\[\nk^2(81^2 + (-108)^2) = 16\n\\]\n\n### Step 35\n\\[\nk^2(6561 + 11664) = 16\n\\]\n\n### Step 36\n\\[\nk^2(18225) = 16\n\\]\n\n### Step 37\n\\[\nk^2 = \\frac{16}{18225}\n\\]\n\n### Step 38\n\\[\nk = \\pm \\frac{4}{135}\n\\]\n\n### Step 39\nTaking the positive \\(k\\) for the maximum value:\n\n### Step 40\n\\[\n(a, b) = \\frac{4}{135}(81, -108) = \\left( \\frac{4 \\times 81}{135}, \\frac{4 \\times (-108)}{135} \\right) = \\left( \\frac{324}{135}, \\frac{-432}{135} \\right) = \\left( \\frac{36}{15}, \\frac{-48}{15} \\right) = \\left( \\frac{12}{5}, \\frac{-16}{5} \\right)\n\\]\n\n### Step 41\nNow, check if \\(a^2 + b^2 = 16\\):\n\n### Step 42\n\\[\n\\left( \\frac{12}{5} \\right)^2 + \\left( \\frac{-16}{5} \\right)^2 = \\frac{144}{25} + \\frac{256}{25} = \\frac{400}{25} = 16\n\\]\n\n### Step 43\nGood, it satisfies the constraint.

I need to find the polar coordinates in the form (r, \u03b8), where r is greater than 0 and \u03b8 is between 0 and 2\u03c0. Alright, let's start by recalling how to convert from rectangular (Cartesian) coordinates to polar coordinates.\n\n### STEP 2\nI know that in polar coordinates, a point is defined by its distance from the origin (that's r) and the angle it makes with the positive x-axis (that's \u03b8). The formulas to convert from rectangular coordinates (x, y) to polar coordinates (r, \u03b8) are:\n\n### STEP 3\nr = \u221a(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)\n\n### STEP 4\n\u03b8 = arctan(y/x)\n\n### STEP 5\nBut I have to be careful with the angle \u03b8 because the arctan function only returns values between -\u03c0/2 and \u03c0/2, and I need to adjust it based on the quadrant in which the point lies to get the correct angle between 0 and 2\u03c0.\n\n### STEP 6\nGiven the point (0,3), let's identify x and y:\n\n### STEP 7\nx = 0\n\n### STEP 8\ny = 3\n\n### STEP 9\nFirst, let's find r:\n\n### STEP 10\nr = \u221a(0\u00b2 + 3\u00b2) = \u221a(0 + 9) = \u221a9 = 3\n\n### STEP 11\nSo, r = 3.\n\n### STEP 12\nNow, let's find \u03b8. The formula is \u03b8 = arctan(y/x), but in this case, x = 0, which would make the denominator zero. That means tan\u03b8 is undefined, which happens at angles where \u03b8 is \u03c0/2 or 3\u03c0/2.\n\n### STEP 13\nLooking at the point (0,3), it's located on the positive y-axis. So, the angle from the positive x-axis to the positive y-axis is \u03c0/2 radians (90 degrees).\n\n### STEP 14\nTherefore, \u03b8 = \u03c0/2.\n\n### STEP 15\nSo, the polar coordinates should be (3, \u03c0/2).\n\n### STEP 16\nBut just to double-check, let's consider the conditions for \u03b8. Since the point is on the positive y-axis, and the arctan function would normally return -\u03c0/2 or \u03c0/2, but in this case, because x is 0 and y is positive, \u03b8 is indeed \u03c0/2.\n\n### STEP 17\nAlso, since r is positive and \u03b8 is between 0 and 2\u03c0, this satisfies the requirements.\n\n### STEP 18\nTherefore, the polar coordinates are (3, \u03c0/2).\n\n### STEP 19\n**Final Answer**\n\n### STEP 20\n\\[ \\boxed{\\left(3,\\,\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)} \\]\n\"\"\"\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Explanation:\n\nSolution Analysis: We will begin by examining the steps that explicitly contain the answer.

Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\n### Step 2\nFirst off, since \\(z\\) is a complex number with \\(|z| = 4\\), I can represent \\(z\\) in polar form. Let's let \\(z = 4e^{i\\theta}\\), where \\(\\theta\\) is a real number. This is because the magnitude is 4, and the direction is arbitrary.\n\n### Step 3\nNow, plugging this into the expression, I get:\n\n### Step 4\n\\[\n(75 + 117i) \\cdot 4e^{i\\theta} + \\frac{96 + 144i}{4e^{i\\theta}}\n\\]\n\n### Step 5\nSimplifying this:\n\n### Step 6\n\\[\n4(75 + 117i)e^{i\\theta} + \\frac{96 + 144i}{4}e^{-i\\theta} = 4(75 + 117i)e^{i\\theta} + (24 + 36i)e^{-i\\theta}\n\\]\n\n### Step 7\nHmm, that seems a bit messy. Maybe there's a better way to approach this. Let's consider that \\(z\\) is on the circle of radius 4, so \\(z \\overline{z} = 16\\), where \\(\\overline{z}\\) is the complex conjugate of \\(z\\). Maybe that can help simplify the expression.\n\n### Step 8\nLet me try expressing \\(\\frac{1}{z}\\) in terms of \\(\\overline{z}\\):\n\n### Step 9\nSince \\(z \\overline{z} = 16\\), then \\(\\frac{1}{z} = \\frac{\\overline{z}}{16}\\).\n\n### Step 10\nSo, the expression becomes:\n\n### Step 11\n\\[\n(75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i) \\cdot \\frac{\\overline{z}}{16} = (75 + 117i)z + \\left(6 + 9i\\right)\\overline{z}\n\\]\n\n### Step 12\nThat's a bit cleaner. Now, let's let \\(z = a + bi\\), where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are real numbers, and \\(a^2 + b^2 = 16\\), since \\(|z| = 4\\).\n\n### Step 13\nThen, \\(\\overline{z} = a - bi\\).\n\n### Step 14\nPlugging these into the expression:\n\n### Step 15\n\\[\n(75 + 117i)(a + bi) + (6 + 9i)(a - bi)\n\\]\n\n### Step 16\nLet's expand both terms:\n\n### Step 17\nFirst term:\n\n### Step 18\n\\[\n(75 + 117i)(a + bi) = 75a + 75bi + 117ai + 117bi^2 = 75a + (75b + 117a)i + 117b(-1) = (75a - 117b) + (75b + 117a)i\n\\]\n\n### Step 19\nSecond term:\n\n### Step 20\n\\[\n(6 + 9i)(a - bi) = 6a - 6bi + 9ai - 9bi^2 = 6a + (9a - 6b)i - 9b(-1) = (6a + 9b) + (9a - 6b)i\n\\]\n\n### Step 21\nNow, add both terms together:\n\n### Step 22\n\\[\n(75a - 117b + 6a + 9b) + (75b + 117a + 9a - 6b)i = (81a - 108b) + (126a + 69b)i\n\\]\n\n### Step 23\nWe're interested in the real part, which is \\(81a - 108b\\). So, our objective is to maximize \\(81a - 108b\\) subject to \\(a^2 + b^2 = 16\\).\n\n### Step 24\nThis is a standard optimization problem with a constraint. We can use the method of Lagrange multipliers or consider it geometrically.\n\n### Step 25\nLet's consider it geometrically. The expression \\(81a - 108b\\) can be thought of as a dot product of the vectors \\((81, -108)\\) and \\((a, b)\\). Given that \\(a^2 + b^2 = 16\\), which is a circle of radius 4 centered at the origin.\n\n### Step 26\nThe maximum value of the dot product occurs when \\((a, b)\\) is in the same direction as \\((81, -108)\\). So, the maximum value is the magnitude of \\((81, -108)\\) times the magnitude of \\((a, b)\\), which is 4.\n\n### Step 27\nFirst, let's find the magnitude of \\((81, -108)\\):\n\n### Step 28\n\\[\n\\sqrt{81^2 + (-108)^2} = \\sqrt{6561 + 11664} = \\sqrt{18225} = 135\n\\]\n\n### Step 29\nTherefore, the maximum value of \\(81a - 108b\\) is \\(135 \\times 4 = 540\\).\n\n### Step 30\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. The magnitude of \\((81, -108)\\) is indeed \\(\\sqrt{81^2 + (-108)^2} = \\sqrt{6561 + 11664} = \\sqrt{18225} = 135\\). And since \\(a^2 + b^2 = 16\\), the maximum value of the dot product is \\(135 \\times 4 = 540\\).\n\n### Step 31\nBut let's confirm if this is achievable. That is, does there exist \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) with \\(a^2 + b^2 = 16\\) such that \\(81a - 108b = 540\\)?\n\n### Step 32\nLet's see. If \\((a, b)\\) is in the direction of \\((81, -108)\\), then we can write \\((a, b) = k(81, -108)\\), where \\(k\\) is a scalar.\n\n### Step 33\nGiven that \\(a^2 + b^2 = 16\\), we have:\n\n### Step 34\n\\[\nk^2(81^2 + (-108)^2) = 16\n\\]\n\n### Step 35\n\\[\nk^2(6561 + 11664) = 16\n\\]\n\n### Step 36\n\\[\nk^2(18225) = 16\n\\]\n\n### Step 37\n\\[\nk^2 = \\frac{16}{18225}\n\\]\n\n### Step 38\n\\[\nk = \\pm \\frac{4}{135}\n\\]\n\n### Step 39\nTaking the positive \\(k\\) for the maximum value:\n\n### Step 40\n\\[\n(a, b) = \\frac{4}{135}(81, -108) = \\left( \\frac{4 \\times 81}{135}, \\frac{4 \\times (-108)}{135} \\right) = \\left( \\frac{324}{135}, \\frac{-432}{135} \\right) = \\left( \\frac{36}{15}, \\frac{-48}{15} \\right) = \\left( \\frac{12}{5}, \\frac{-16}{5} \\right)\n\\]\n\n### Step 41\nNow, check if \\(a^2 + b^2 = 16\\):\n\n### Step 42\n\\[\n\\left( \\frac{12}{5} \\right)^2 + \\left( \\frac{-16}{5} \\right)^2 = \\frac{144}{25} + \\frac{256}{25} = \\frac{400}{25} = 16\n\\]\n\n### Step 43\nGood, it satisfies the constraint.

Alright, let's start by recalling how to convert from rectangular (Cartesian) coordinates to polar coordinates.\n\n### STEP 2\nI know that in polar coordinates, a point is defined by its distance from the origin (that's r) and the angle it makes with the positive x-axis (that's \u03b8). The formulas to convert from rectangular coordinates (x, y) to polar coordinates (r, \u03b8) are:\n\n### STEP 3\nr = \u221a(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)\n\n### STEP 4\n\u03b8 = arctan(y/x)\n\n### STEP 5\nBut I have to be careful with the angle \u03b8 because the arctan function only returns values between -\u03c0/2 and \u03c0/2, and I need to adjust it based on the quadrant in which the point lies to get the correct angle between 0 and 2\u03c0.\n\n### STEP 6\nGiven the point (0,3), let's identify x and y:\n\n### STEP 7\nx = 0\n\n### STEP 8\ny = 3\n\n### STEP 9\nFirst, let's find r:\n\n### STEP 10\nr = \u221a(0\u00b2 + 3\u00b2) = \u221a(0 + 9) = \u221a9 = 3\n\n### STEP 11\nSo, r = 3.\n\n### STEP 12\nNow, let's find \u03b8. The formula is \u03b8 = arctan(y/x), but in this case, x = 0, which would make the denominator zero. That means tan\u03b8 is undefined, which happens at angles where \u03b8 is \u03c0/2 or 3\u03c0/2.\n\n### STEP 13\nLooking at the point (0,3), it's located on the positive y-axis. So, the angle from the positive x-axis to the positive y-axis is \u03c0/2 radians (90 degrees).\n\n### STEP 14\nTherefore, \u03b8 = \u03c0/2.\n\n### STEP 15\nSo, the polar coordinates should be (3, \u03c0/2).\n\n### STEP 16\nBut just to double-check, let's consider the conditions for \u03b8. Since the point is on the positive y-axis, and the arctan function would normally return -\u03c0/2 or \u03c0/2, but in this case, because x is 0 and y is positive, \u03b8 is indeed \u03c0/2.\n\n### STEP 17\nAlso, since r is positive and \u03b8 is between 0 and 2\u03c0, this satisfies the requirements.\n\n### STEP 18\nTherefore, the polar coordinates are (3, \u03c0/2).\n\n### STEP 19\n**Final Answer**\n\n### STEP 20\n\\[ \\boxed{\\left(3,\\,\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)} \\]\n\"\"\"\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Explanation:\n\nSolution Analysis: We will begin by examining the steps that explicitly contain the answer.

We want to clearly distinguish these two energy levels. Which one of the following options could be their energy difference so that they can be clearly resolved?\n\nA: 10^-9 eV\nB: 10^-8 eV\n\nC: 10^-4 eV\nD: 10^-11 eV\n\"\"\"\n\nSolution:\n\"\"\"\n###STEP 1\nSo I've got this question about quantum states and their energies, and I need to figure out which energy difference would allow me to clearly distinguish between two energy levels, E1 and E2, with different lifetimes. The lifetimes are given as 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. The options for the energy difference are in electronvolts (eV), and I need to choose which one would make these energy levels clearly resolved.\n\n###STEP 2\nFirst, I need to understand what it means to \"clearly distinguish\" or \"clearly resolve\" two energy levels in quantum mechanics. I think this has something to do with the uncertainty principle, specifically the energy-time uncertainty relation. The energy-time uncertainty principle states that the uncertainty in energy (\u0394E) and the uncertainty in time (\u0394t) are related by:\n\n###STEP 3\n\u0394E * \u0394t \u2265 \u0127/2\n\n###STEP 4\nWhere \u0127 is the reduced Planck's constant. This relation tells us that the more precisely we know the energy (small \u0394E), the less precisely we know the time (large \u0394t), and vice versa.\n\n###STEP 5\nIn this context, the lifetime of a quantum state is related to the uncertainty in its energy. The longer the lifetime, the smaller the energy uncertainty, and thus the energy levels can be more precisely determined.\n\n###STEP 6\nGiven that, the two energy levels have different lifetimes: 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds. To clearly distinguish them, the energy difference between E1 and E2 should be greater than the sum of their energy uncertainties.\n\n###STEP 7\nSo, \u0394E_total \u2265 \u0394E1 + \u0394E2\n\n###STEP 8\nWhere \u0394E1 and \u0394E2 are the uncertainties in energy for each state, related to their lifetimes by:\n\n###STEP 9\n\u0394E = \u0127 / (2 * \u0394t)\n\n###STEP 10\nBut since the lifetimes are different, I need to calculate \u0394E1 and \u0394E2 separately.\n\n###STEP 11\nFirst, let's recall that \u0127 (reduced Planck's constant) is approximately 1.0545718 \u00d7 10^-34 Js.\n\n###STEP 12\nGiven that, for the first state with lifetime \u0394t1 = 10^-9 s:\n\n###STEP 13\n\u0394E1 = \u0127 / (2 * \u0394t1) = (1.0545718 \u00d7 10^-34 Js) / (2 * 10^-9 s) \u2248 5.272859 \u00d7 10^-26 J\n\n###STEP 14\nSimilarly, for the second state with lifetime \u0394t2 = 10^-8 s:\n\n###STEP 15\n\u0394E2 = \u0127 / (2 * \u0394t2) = (1.0545718 \u00d7 10^-34 Js) / (2 * 10^-8 s) \u2248 5.272859 \u00d7 10^-27 J\n\n###STEP 16\nNow, to find the total energy uncertainty for distinguishing the two levels, I should consider the sum of these uncertainties:\n\n###STEP 17\n\u0394E_total = \u0394E1 + \u0394E2 \u2248 5.272859 \u00d7 10^-26 J + 5.272859 \u00d7 10^-27 J \u2248 5.800145 \u00d7 10^-26 J\n\n###STEP 18\nBut the options are given in electronvolts (eV), so I need to convert this energy uncertainty from joules to electronvolts. The conversion factor is:\n\n###STEP 19\n1 eV = 1.602176634 \u00d7 10^-19 J\n\n###STEP 20\nTherefore,\n\n###STEP 21\n\u0394E_total (in eV) = (5.800145 \u00d7 10^-26 J) / (1.602176634 \u00d7 10^-19 J/eV) \u2248 3.62 \u00d7 10^-7 eV\n\n###STEP 22\nSo, the total energy uncertainty is approximately 3.62 \u00d7 10^-7 eV.

Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\n### Step 2\nFirst off, since \\(z\\) is a complex number with \\(|z| = 4\\), I can represent \\(z\\) in polar form. Let's let \\(z = 4e^{i\\theta}\\), where \\(\\theta\\) is a real number. This is because the magnitude is 4, and the direction is arbitrary.\n\n### Step 3\nNow, plugging this into the expression, I get:\n\n### Step 4\n\\[\n(75 + 117i) \\cdot 4e^{i\\theta} + \\frac{96 + 144i}{4e^{i\\theta}}\n\\]\n\n### Step 5\nSimplifying this:\n\n### Step 6\n\\[\n4(75 + 117i)e^{i\\theta} + \\frac{96 + 144i}{4}e^{-i\\theta} = 4(75 + 117i)e^{i\\theta} + (24 + 36i)e^{-i\\theta}\n\\]\n\n### Step 7\nHmm, that seems a bit messy. Maybe there's a better way to approach this. Let's consider that \\(z\\) is on the circle of radius 4, so \\(z \\overline{z} = 16\\), where \\(\\overline{z}\\) is the complex conjugate of \\(z\\). Maybe that can help simplify the expression.\n\n### Step 8\nLet me try expressing \\(\\frac{1}{z}\\) in terms of \\(\\overline{z}\\):\n\n### Step 9\nSince \\(z \\overline{z} = 16\\), then \\(\\frac{1}{z} = \\frac{\\overline{z}}{16}\\).\n\n### Step 10\nSo, the expression becomes:\n\n### Step 11\n\\[\n(75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i) \\cdot \\frac{\\overline{z}}{16} = (75 + 117i)z + \\left(6 + 9i\\right)\\overline{z}\n\\]\n\n### Step 12\nThat's a bit cleaner.

So, our objective is to maximize \\(81a - 108b\\) subject to \\(a^2 + b^2 = 16\\).\n\n### Step 24\nThis is a standard optimization problem with a constraint. We can use the method of Lagrange multipliers or consider it geometrically.\n\n### Step 25\nLet's consider it geometrically. The expression \\(81a - 108b\\) can be thought of as a dot product of the vectors \\((81, -108)\\) and \\((a, b)\\). Given that \\(a^2 + b^2 = 16\\), which is a circle of radius 4 centered at the origin.\n\n### Step 26\nThe maximum value of the dot product occurs when \\((a, b)\\) is in the same direction as \\((81, -108)\\). So, the maximum value is the magnitude of \\((81, -108)\\) times the magnitude of \\((a, b)\\), which is 4.\n\n### Step 27\nFirst, let's find the magnitude of \\((81, -108)\\):\n\n### Step 28\n\\[\n\\sqrt{81^2 + (-108)^2} = \\sqrt{6561 + 11664} = \\sqrt{18225} = 135\n\\]\n\n### Step 29\nTherefore, the maximum value of \\(81a - 108b\\) is \\(135 \\times 4 = 540\\).\n\n### Step 30\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. The magnitude of \\((81, -108)\\) is indeed \\(\\sqrt{81^2 + (-108)^2} = \\sqrt{6561 + 11664} = \\sqrt{18225} = 135\\). And since \\(a^2 + b^2 = 16\\), the maximum value of the dot product is \\(135 \\times 4 = 540\\).\n\n### Step 31\nBut let's confirm if this is achievable. That is, does there exist \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) with \\(a^2 + b^2 = 16\\) such that \\(81a - 108b = 540\\)?\n\n### Step 32\nLet's see. If \\((a, b)\\) is in the direction of \\((81, -108)\\), then we can write \\((a, b) = k(81, -108)\\), where \\(k\\) is a scalar.\n\n### Step 33\nGiven that \\(a^2 + b^2 = 16\\), we have:\n\n### Step 34\n\\[\nk^2(81^2 + (-108)^2) = 16\n\\]\n\n### Step 35\n\\[\nk^2(6561 + 11664) = 16\n\\]\n\n### Step 36\n\\[\nk^2(18225) = 16\n\\]\n\n### Step 37\n\\[\nk^2 = \\frac{16}{18225}\n\\]\n\n### Step 38\n\\[\nk = \\pm \\frac{4}{135}\n\\]\n\n### Step 39\nTaking the positive \\(k\\) for the maximum value:\n\n### Step 40\n\\[\n(a, b) = \\frac{4}{135}(81, -108) = \\left( \\frac{4 \\times 81}{135}, \\frac{4 \\times (-108)}{135} \\right) = \\left( \\frac{324}{135}, \\frac{-432}{135} \\right) = \\left( \\frac{36}{15}, \\frac{-48}{15} \\right) = \\left( \\frac{12}{5}, \\frac{-16}{5} \\right)\n\\]\n\n### Step 41\nNow, check if \\(a^2 + b^2 = 16\\):\n\n### Step 42\n\\[\n\\left( \\frac{12}{5} \\right)^2 + \\left( \\frac{-16}{5} \\right)^2 = \\frac{144}{25} + \\frac{256}{25} = \\frac{400}{25} = 16\n\\]\n\n### Step 43\nGood, it satisfies the constraint.

I need to find the polar coordinates in the form (r, \u03b8), where r is greater than 0 and \u03b8 is between 0 and 2\u03c0. Alright, let's start by recalling how to convert from rectangular (Cartesian) coordinates to polar coordinates.\n\n###STEP 2\nI know that in polar coordinates, a point is defined by its distance from the origin (that's r) and the angle it makes with the positive x-axis (that's \u03b8).

Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\n### Step 2\nFirst off, since \\(z\\) is a complex number with \\(|z| = 4\\), I can represent \\(z\\) in polar form. Let's let \\(z = 4e^{i\\theta}\\), where \\(\\theta\\) is a real number.

Maybe there's a better way to approach this. Let's consider that \\(z\\) is on the circle of radius 4, so \\(z \\overline{z} = 16\\), where \\(\\overline{z}\\) is the complex conjugate of \\(z\\). Maybe that can help simplify the expression.\n\n### Step 8\nLet me try expressing \\(\\frac{1}{z}\\) in terms of \\(\\overline{z}\\):\n\n### Step 9\nSince \\(z \\overline{z} = 16\\), then \\(\\frac{1}{z} = \\frac{\\overline{z}}{16}\\).\n\n### Step 10\nSo, the expression becomes:\n\n### Step 11\n\\[\n(75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i) \\cdot \\frac{\\overline{z}}{16} = (75 + 117i)z + \\left(6 + 9i\\right)\\overline{z}\n\\]\n\n### Step 12\nThat's a bit cleaner.

So, our objective is to maximize \\(81a - 108b\\) subject to \\(a^2 + b^2 = 16\\).\n\n### Step 24\nThis is a standard optimization problem with a constraint. We can use the method of Lagrange multipliers or consider it geometrically.\n\n### Step 25\nLet's consider it geometrically. The expression \\(81a - 108b\\) can be thought of as a dot product of the vectors \\((81, -108)\\) and \\((a, b)\\). Given that \\(a^2 + b^2 = 16\\), which is a circle of radius 4 centered at the origin.\n\n### Step 26\nThe maximum value of the dot product occurs when \\((a, b)\\) is in the same direction as \\((81, -108)\\). So, the maximum value is the magnitude of \\((81, -108)\\) times the magnitude of \\((a, b)\\), which is 4.\n\n### Step 27\nFirst, let's find the magnitude of \\((81, -108)\\):\n\n### Step 28\n\\[\n\\sqrt{81^2 + (-108)^2} = \\sqrt{6561 + 11664} = \\sqrt{18225} = 135\n\\]\n\n### Step 29\nTherefore, the maximum value of \\(81a - 108b\\) is \\(135 \\times 4 = 540\\).\n\n### Step 30\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. The magnitude of \\((81, -108)\\) is indeed \\(\\sqrt{81^2 + (-108)^2} = \\sqrt{6561 + 11664} = \\sqrt{18225} = 135\\). And since \\(a^2 + b^2 = 16\\), the maximum value of the dot product is \\(135 \\times 4 = 540\\).\n\n### Step 31\nBut let's confirm if this is achievable. That is, does there exist \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) with \\(a^2 + b^2 = 16\\) such that \\(81a - 108b = 540\\)?\n\n### Step 32\nLet's see. If \\((a, b)\\) is in the direction of \\((81, -108)\\), then we can write \\((a, b) = k(81, -108)\\), where \\(k\\) is a scalar.\n\n### Step 33\nGiven that \\(a^2 + b^2 = 16\\), we have:\n\n### Step 34\n\\[\nk^2(81^2 + (-108)^2) = 16\n\\]\n\n### Step 35\n\\[\nk^2(6561 + 11664) = 16\n\\]\n\n### Step 36\n\\[\nk^2(18225) = 16\n\\]\n\n### Step 37\n\\[\nk^2 = \\frac{16}{18225}\n\\]\n\n### Step 38\n\\[\nk = \\pm \\frac{4}{135}\n\\]\n\n### Step 39\nTaking the positive \\(k\\) for the maximum value:\n\n### Step 40\n\\[\n(a, b) = \\frac{4}{135}(81, -108) = \\left( \\frac{4 \\times 81}{135}, \\frac{4 \\times (-108)}{135} \\right) = \\left( \\frac{324}{135}, \\frac{-432}{135} \\right) = \\left( \\frac{36}{15}, \\frac{-48}{15} \\right) = \\left( \\frac{12}{5}, \\frac{-16}{5} \\right)\n\\]\n\n### Step 41\nNow, check if \\(a^2 + b^2 = 16\\):\n\n### Step 42\n\\[\n\\left( \\frac{12}{5} \\right)^2 + \\left( \\frac{-16}{5} \\right)^2 = \\frac{144}{25} + \\frac{256}{25} = \\frac{400}{25} = 16\n\\]\n\n### Step 43\nGood, it satisfies the constraint.

Enter your answer in the form $(r,\\\\theta),$ where $r > 0$ and $0 \\\\le \\\\theta < 2 \\\\pi.$'\n\"\"\"\n\nSolution:\n\"\"\"\n### STEP 1\nSo I have this problem here: convert the point (0,3) in rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates. I need to find the polar coordinates in the form (r, \u03b8), where r is greater than 0 and \u03b8 is between 0 and 2\u03c0. Alright, let's start by recalling how to convert from rectangular (Cartesian) coordinates to polar coordinates.\n\n### STEP 2\nI know that in polar coordinates, a point is defined by its distance from the origin (that's r) and the angle it makes with the positive x-axis (that's \u03b8). The formulas to convert from rectangular coordinates (x, y) to polar coordinates (r, \u03b8) are:\n\n### STEP 3\nr = \u221a(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)\n\n### STEP 4\n\u03b8 = arctan(y/x)\n\n### STEP 5\nBut I have to be careful with the angle \u03b8 because the arctan function only returns values between -\u03c0/2 and \u03c0/2, and I need to adjust it based on the quadrant in which the point lies to get the correct angle between 0 and 2\u03c0.\n\n### STEP 6\nGiven the point (0,3), let's identify x and y:\n\n### STEP 7\nx = 0\n\n### STEP 8\ny = 3\n\n### STEP 9\nFirst, let's find r:\n\n### STEP 10\nr = \u221a(0\u00b2 + 3\u00b2) = \u221a(0 + 9) = \u221a9 = 3\n\n### STEP 11\nSo, r = 3.\n\n### STEP 12\nNow, let's find \u03b8. The formula is \u03b8 = arctan(y/x), but in this case, x = 0, which would make the denominator zero. That means tan\u03b8 is undefined, which happens at angles where \u03b8 is \u03c0/2 or 3\u03c0/2.\n\n### STEP 13\nLooking at the point (0,3), it's located on the positive y-axis. So, the angle from the positive x-axis to the positive y-axis is \u03c0/2 radians (90 degrees).\n\n### STEP 14\nTherefore, \u03b8 = \u03c0/2.\n\n### STEP 15\nSo, the polar coordinates should be (3, \u03c0/2).\n\n### STEP 16\nBut just to double-check, let's consider the conditions for \u03b8. Since the point is on the positive y-axis, and the arctan function would normally return -\u03c0/2 or \u03c0/2, but in this case, because x is 0 and y is positive, \u03b8 is indeed \u03c0/2.\n\n### STEP 17\nAlso, since r is positive and \u03b8 is between 0 and 2\u03c0, this satisfies the requirements.\n\n### STEP 18\nTherefore, the polar coordinates are (3, \u03c0/2).\n\n### STEP 19\n**Final Answer**\n\n### STEP 20\n\\[ \\boxed{\\left(3,\\,\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)} \\]\n\"\"\"\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Explanation:\n\nSolution Analysis: We will begin by examining the steps that explicitly contain the answer.

Maybe that can help simplify the expression.\n\n### Step 8\nLet me try expressing \\(\\frac{1}{z}\\) in terms of \\(\\overline{z}\\):\n\n### Step 9\nSince \\(z \\overline{z} = 16\\), then \\(\\frac{1}{z} = \\frac{\\overline{z}}{16}\\).\n\n### Step 10\nSo, the expression becomes:\n\n### Step 11\n\\[\n(75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i) \\cdot \\frac{\\overline{z}}{16} = (75 + 117i)z + \\left(6 + 9i\\right)\\overline{z}\n\\]\n\n### Step 12\nThat's a bit cleaner. Now, let's let \\(z = a + bi\\), where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are real numbers, and \\(a^2 + b^2 = 16\\), since \\(|z| = 4\\).\n\n### Step 13\nThen, \\(\\overline{z} = a - bi\\).\n\n### Step 14\nPlugging these into the expression:\n\n### Step 15\n\\[\n(75 + 117i)(a + bi) + (6 + 9i)(a - bi)\n\\]\n\n### Step 16\nLet's expand both terms:\n\n### Step 17\nFirst term:\n\n### Step 18\n\\[\n(75 + 117i)(a + bi) = 75a + 75bi + 117ai + 117bi^2 = 75a + (75b + 117a)i + 117b(-1) = (75a - 117b) + (75b + 117a)i\n\\]\n\n### Step 19\nSecond term:\n\n### Step 20\n\\[\n(6 + 9i)(a - bi) = 6a - 6bi + 9ai - 9bi^2 = 6a + (9a - 6b)i - 9b(-1) = (6a + 9b) + (9a - 6b)i\n\\]\n\n### Step 21\nNow, add both terms together:\n\n### Step 22\n\\[\n(75a - 117b + 6a + 9b) + (75b + 117a + 9a - 6b)i = (81a - 108b) + (126a + 69b)i\n\\]\n\n### Step 23\nWe're interested in the real part, which is \\(81a - 108b\\). So, our objective is to maximize \\(81a - 108b\\) subject to \\(a^2 + b^2 = 16\\).\n\n### Step 24\nThis is a standard optimization problem with a constraint. We can use the method of Lagrange multipliers or consider it geometrically.\n\n### Step 25\nLet's consider it geometrically. The expression \\(81a - 108b\\) can be thought of as a dot product of the vectors \\((81, -108)\\) and \\((a, b)\\). Given that \\(a^2 + b^2 = 16\\), which is a circle of radius 4 centered at the origin.\n\n### Step 26\nThe maximum value of the dot product occurs when \\((a, b)\\) is in the same direction as \\((81, -108)\\). So, the maximum value is the magnitude of \\((81, -108)\\) times the magnitude of \\((a, b)\\), which is 4.\n\n### Step 27\nFirst, let's find the magnitude of \\((81, -108)\\):\n\n### Step 28\n\\[\n\\sqrt{81^2 + (-108)^2} = \\sqrt{6561 + 11664} = \\sqrt{18225} = 135\n\\]\n\n### Step 29\nTherefore, the maximum value of \\(81a - 108b\\) is \\(135 \\times 4 = 540\\).\n\n### Step 30\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. The magnitude of \\((81, -108)\\) is indeed \\(\\sqrt{81^2 + (-108)^2} = \\sqrt{6561 + 11664} = \\sqrt{18225} = 135\\). And since \\(a^2 + b^2 = 16\\), the maximum value of the dot product is \\(135 \\times 4 = 540\\).\n\n### Step 31\nBut let's confirm if this is achievable. That is, does there exist \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) with \\(a^2 + b^2 = 16\\) such that \\(81a - 108b = 540\\)?\n\n### Step 32\nLet's see. If \\((a, b)\\) is in the direction of \\((81, -108)\\), then we can write \\((a, b) = k(81, -108)\\), where \\(k\\) is a scalar.\n\n### Step 33\nGiven that \\(a^2 + b^2 = 16\\), we have:\n\n### Step 34\n\\[\nk^2(81^2 + (-108)^2) = 16\n\\]\n\n### Step 35\n\\[\nk^2(6561 + 11664) = 16\n\\]\n\n### Step 36\n\\[\nk^2(18225) = 16\n\\]\n\n### Step 37\n\\[\nk^2 = \\frac{16}{18225}\n\\]\n\n### Step 38\n\\[\nk = \\pm \\frac{4}{135}\n\\]\n\n### Step 39\nTaking the positive \\(k\\) for the maximum value:\n\n### Step 40\n\\[\n(a, b) = \\frac{4}{135}(81, -108) = \\left( \\frac{4 \\times 81}{135}, \\frac{4 \\times (-108)}{135} \\right) = \\left( \\frac{324}{135}, \\frac{-432}{135} \\right) = \\left( \\frac{36}{15}, \\frac{-48}{15} \\right) = \\left( \\frac{12}{5}, \\frac{-16}{5} \\right)\n\\]\n\n### Step 41\nNow, check if \\(a^2 + b^2 = 16\\):\n\n### Step 42\n\\[\n\\left( \\frac{12}{5} \\right)^2 + \\left( \\frac{-16}{5} \\right)^2 = \\frac{144}{25} + \\frac{256}{25} = \\frac{400}{25} = 16\n\\]\n\n### Step 43\nGood, it satisfies the constraint.

Enter your answer in the form $(r,\\\\theta),$ where $r > 0$ and $0 \\\\le \\\\theta < 2 \\\\pi.$'\n\"\"\"\n\nSolution:\n\"\"\"\n### STEP 1\nSo I have this problem here: convert the point (0,3) in rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates. I need to find the polar coordinates in the form (r, \u03b8), where r is greater than 0 and \u03b8 is between 0 and 2\u03c0. Alright, let's start by recalling how to convert from rectangular (Cartesian) coordinates to polar coordinates.\n\n### STEP 2\nI know that in polar coordinates, a point is defined by its distance from the origin (that's r) and the angle it makes with the positive x-axis (that's \u03b8). The formulas to convert from rectangular coordinates (x, y) to polar coordinates (r, \u03b8) are:\n\n### STEP 3\nr = \u221a(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)\n\n### STEP 4\n\u03b8 = arctan(y/x)\n\n### STEP 5\nBut I have to be careful with the angle \u03b8 because the arctan function only returns values between -\u03c0/2 and \u03c0/2, and I need to adjust it based on the quadrant in which the point lies to get the correct angle between 0 and 2\u03c0.\n\n### STEP 6\nGiven the point (0,3), let's identify x and y:\n\n### STEP 7\nx = 0\n\n### STEP 8\ny = 3\n\n### STEP 9\nFirst, let's find r:\n\n### STEP 10\nr = \u221a(0\u00b2 + 3\u00b2) = \u221a(0 + 9) = \u221a9 = 3\n\n### STEP 11\nSo, r = 3.\n\n### STEP 12\nNow, let's find \u03b8. The formula is \u03b8 = arctan(y/x), but in this case, x = 0, which would make the denominator zero. That means tan\u03b8 is undefined, which happens at angles where \u03b8 is \u03c0/2 or 3\u03c0/2.\n\n### STEP 13\nLooking at the point (0,3), it's located on the positive y-axis. So, the angle from the positive x-axis to the positive y-axis is \u03c0/2 radians (90 degrees).\n\n### STEP 14\nTherefore, \u03b8 = \u03c0/2.\n\n### STEP 15\nSo, the polar coordinates should be (3, \u03c0/2).\n\n### STEP 16\nBut just to double-check, let's consider the conditions for \u03b8. Since the point is on the positive y-axis, and the arctan function would normally return -\u03c0/2 or \u03c0/2, but in this case, because x is 0 and y is positive, \u03b8 is indeed \u03c0/2.\n\n### STEP 17\nAlso, since r is positive and \u03b8 is between 0 and 2\u03c0, this satisfies the requirements.\n\n### STEP 18\nTherefore, the polar coordinates are (3, \u03c0/2).\n\n### STEP 19\n**Final Answer**\n\n### STEP 20\n\\[ \\boxed{\\left(3,\\,\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)} \\]\n\"\"\"\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Explanation:\n\nSolution Analysis: We will begin by examining the steps that explicitly contain the answer.

That seems straightforward. Then, she eats three eggs for breakfast every morning. Okay, so out of the 16 eggs, she consumes three herself. That means the number of eggs left after she eats is 16 minus 3, which is 13 eggs.\n\n###STEP 2\nNext, she bakes muffins for her friends every day and uses four eggs for that. So, from the remaining 13 eggs, she uses four for baking. That leaves her with 13 minus 4, which is 9 eggs.\n\n###STEP 3\nNow, she sells these remaining eggs at the farmers' market for $2 per fresh duck egg. So, she has 9 eggs to sell, and each egg sells for $2. To find out how much she makes daily from selling eggs, I need to multiply the number of eggs she sells by the price per egg.\n\n###STEP 4\nSo, 9 eggs times $2 per egg equals $18.\n\n###STEP 5\nWait, but let me double-check that.

I don't think I missed anything here. The problem is pretty straightforward once you break it down step by step.\n\n###STEP 15\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there are any other costs or factors involved. For example, are there any costs associated with baking the muffins or selling at the farmers' market that might affect her net earnings? The problem doesn't mention any costs beyond the eggs themselves, so it seems like the $18 is her net income from selling the eggs.\n\n###STEP 16\nAlso, ensure that the selling price is indeed $2 per fresh duck egg and not per dozen or anything like that. The problem specifies $2 per fresh duck egg, so that's correct.\n\n###STEP 17\nAnother thing to consider is whether the number of eggs laid per day is consistent.

Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\n### Step 2\nFirst off, since \\(z\\) is a complex number with \\(|z| = 4\\), I can represent \\(z\\) in polar form. Let's let \\(z = 4e^{i\\theta}\\), where \\(\\theta\\) is a real number. This is because the magnitude is 4, and the direction is arbitrary.\n\n### Step 3\nNow, plugging this into the expression, I get:\n\n### Step 4\n\\[\n(75 + 117i) \\cdot 4e^{i\\theta} + \\frac{96 + 144i}{4e^{i\\theta}}\n\\]\n\n### Step 5\nSimplifying this:\n\n### Step 6\n\\[\n4(75 + 117i)e^{i\\theta} + \\frac{96 + 144i}{4}e^{-i\\theta} = 4(75 + 117i)e^{i\\theta} + (24 + 36i)e^{-i\\theta}\n\\]\n\n### Step 7\nHmm, that seems a bit messy. Maybe there's a better way to approach this. Let's consider that \\(z\\) is on the circle of radius 4, so \\(z \\overline{z} = 16\\), where \\(\\overline{z}\\) is the complex conjugate of \\(z\\). Maybe that can help simplify the expression.\n\n### Step 8\nLet me try expressing \\(\\frac{1}{z}\\) in terms of \\(\\overline{z}\\):\n\n### Step 9\nSince \\(z \\overline{z} = 16\\), then \\(\\frac{1}{z} = \\frac{\\overline{z}}{16}\\).\n\n### Step 10\nSo, the expression becomes:\n\n### Step 11\n\\[\n(75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i) \\cdot \\frac{\\overline{z}}{16} = (75 + 117i)z + \\left(6 + 9i\\right)\\overline{z}\n\\]\n\n### Step 12\nThat's a bit cleaner. Now, let's let \\(z = a + bi\\), where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are real numbers, and \\(a^2 + b^2 = 16\\), since \\(|z| = 4\\).\n\n### Step 13\nThen, \\(\\overline{z} = a - bi\\).\n\n### Step 14\nPlugging these into the expression:\n\n### Step 15\n\\[\n(75 + 117i)(a + bi) + (6 + 9i)(a - bi)\n\\]\n\n### Step 16\nLet's expand both terms:\n\n### Step 17\nFirst term:\n\n### Step 18\n\\[\n(75 + 117i)(a + bi) = 75a + 75bi + 117ai + 117bi^2 = 75a + (75b + 117a)i + 117b(-1) = (75a - 117b) + (75b + 117a)i\n\\]\n\n### Step 19\nSecond term:\n\n### Step 20\n\\[\n(6 + 9i)(a - bi) = 6a - 6bi + 9ai - 9bi^2 = 6a + (9a - 6b)i - 9b(-1) = (6a + 9b) + (9a - 6b)i\n\\]\n\n### Step 21\nNow, add both terms together:\n\n### Step 22\n\\[\n(75a - 117b + 6a + 9b) + (75b + 117a + 9a - 6b)i = (81a - 108b) + (126a + 69b)i\n\\]\n\n### Step 23\nWe're interested in the real part, which is \\(81a - 108b\\). So, our objective is to maximize \\(81a - 108b\\) subject to \\(a^2 + b^2 = 16\\).\n\n### Step 24\nThis is a standard optimization problem with a constraint. We can use the method of Lagrange multipliers or consider it geometrically.\n\n### Step 25\nLet's consider it geometrically. The expression \\(81a - 108b\\) can be thought of as a dot product of the vectors \\((81, -108)\\) and \\((a, b)\\). Given that \\(a^2 + b^2 = 16\\), which is a circle of radius 4 centered at the origin.\n\n### Step 26\nThe maximum value of the dot product occurs when \\((a, b)\\) is in the same direction as \\((81, -108)\\). So, the maximum value is the magnitude of \\((81, -108)\\) times the magnitude of \\((a, b)\\), which is 4.\n\n### Step 27\nFirst, let's find the magnitude of \\((81, -108)\\):\n\n### Step 28\n\\[\n\\sqrt{81^2 + (-108)^2} = \\sqrt{6561 + 11664} = \\sqrt{18225} = 135\n\\]\n\n### Step 29\nTherefore, the maximum value of \\(81a - 108b\\) is \\(135 \\times 4 = 540\\).\n\n### Step 30\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. The magnitude of \\((81, -108)\\) is indeed \\(\\sqrt{81^2 + (-108)^2} = \\sqrt{6561 + 11664} = \\sqrt{18225} = 135\\). And since \\(a^2 + b^2 = 16\\), the maximum value of the dot product is \\(135 \\times 4 = 540\\).\n\n### Step 31\nBut let's confirm if this is achievable. That is, does there exist \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) with \\(a^2 + b^2 = 16\\) such that \\(81a - 108b = 540\\)?\n\n### Step 32\nLet's see. If \\((a, b)\\) is in the direction of \\((81, -108)\\), then we can write \\((a, b) = k(81, -108)\\), where \\(k\\) is a scalar.\n\n### Step 33\nGiven that \\(a^2 + b^2 = 16\\), we have:\n\n### Step 34\n\\[\nk^2(81^2 + (-108)^2) = 16\n\\]\n\n### Step 35\n\\[\nk^2(6561 + 11664) = 16\n\\]\n\n### Step 36\n\\[\nk^2(18225) = 16\n\\]\n\n### Step 37\n\\[\nk^2 = \\frac{16}{18225}\n\\]\n\n### Step 38\n\\[\nk = \\pm \\frac{4}{135}\n\\]\n\n### Step 39\nTaking the positive \\(k\\) for the maximum value:\n\n### Step 40\n\\[\n(a, b) = \\frac{4}{135}(81, -108) = \\left( \\frac{4 \\times 81}{135}, \\frac{4 \\times (-108)}{135} \\right) = \\left( \\frac{324}{135}, \\frac{-432}{135} \\right) = \\left( \\frac{36}{15}, \\frac{-48}{15} \\right) = \\left( \\frac{12}{5}, \\frac{-16}{5} \\right)\n\\]\n\n### Step 41\nNow, check if \\(a^2 + b^2 = 16\\):\n\n### Step 42\n\\[\n\\left( \\frac{12}{5} \\right)^2 + \\left( \\frac{-16}{5} \\right)^2 = \\frac{144}{25} + \\frac{256}{25} = \\frac{400}{25} = 16\n\\]\n\n### Step 43\nGood, it satisfies the constraint.

I need to find the polar coordinates in the form (r, \u03b8), where r is greater than 0 and \u03b8 is between 0 and 2\u03c0. Alright, let's start by recalling how to convert from rectangular (Cartesian) coordinates to polar coordinates.\n\n### STEP 2\nI know that in polar coordinates, a point is defined by its distance from the origin (that's r) and the angle it makes with the positive x-axis (that's \u03b8). The formulas to convert from rectangular coordinates (x, y) to polar coordinates (r, \u03b8) are:\n\n### STEP 3\nr = \u221a(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)\n\n### STEP 4\n\u03b8 = arctan(y/x)\n\n### STEP 5\nBut I have to be careful with the angle \u03b8 because the arctan function only returns values between -\u03c0/2 and \u03c0/2, and I need to adjust it based on the quadrant in which the point lies to get the correct angle between 0 and 2\u03c0.\n\n### STEP 6\nGiven the point (0,3), let's identify x and y:\n\n### STEP 7\nx = 0\n\n### STEP 8\ny = 3\n\n### STEP 9\nFirst, let's find r:\n\n### STEP 10\nr = \u221a(0\u00b2 + 3\u00b2) = \u221a(0 + 9) = \u221a9 = 3\n\n### STEP 11\nSo, r = 3.\n\n### STEP 12\nNow, let's find \u03b8. The formula is \u03b8 = arctan(y/x), but in this case, x = 0, which would make the denominator zero. That means tan\u03b8 is undefined, which happens at angles where \u03b8 is \u03c0/2 or 3\u03c0/2.\n\n### STEP 13\nLooking at the point (0,3), it's located on the positive y-axis. So, the angle from the positive x-axis to the positive y-axis is \u03c0/2 radians (90 degrees).\n\n### STEP 14\nTherefore, \u03b8 = \u03c0/2.\n\n### STEP 15\nSo, the polar coordinates should be (3, \u03c0/2).\n\n### STEP 16\nBut just to double-check, let's consider the conditions for \u03b8. Since the point is on the positive y-axis, and the arctan function would normally return -\u03c0/2 or \u03c0/2, but in this case, because x is 0 and y is positive, \u03b8 is indeed \u03c0/2.\n\n### STEP 17\nAlso, since r is positive and \u03b8 is between 0 and 2\u03c0, this satisfies the requirements.\n\n### STEP 18\nTherefore, the polar coordinates are (3, \u03c0/2).\n\n### STEP 19\n**Final Answer**\n\n### STEP 20\n\\[ \\boxed{\\left(3,\\,\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)} \\]\n\"\"\"\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Explanation:\n\nSolution Analysis: We will begin by examining the steps that explicitly contain the answer.

Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\n### Step 2\nFirst off, since \\(z\\) is a complex number with \\(|z| = 4\\), I can represent \\(z\\) in polar form. Let's let \\(z = 4e^{i\\theta}\\), where \\(\\theta\\) is a real number.

Maybe there's a better way to approach this. Let's consider that \\(z\\) is on the circle of radius 4, so \\(z \\overline{z} = 16\\), where \\(\\overline{z}\\) is the complex conjugate of \\(z\\). Maybe that can help simplify the expression.\n\n### Step 8\nLet me try expressing \\(\\frac{1}{z}\\) in terms of \\(\\overline{z}\\):\n\n### Step 9\nSince \\(z \\overline{z} = 16\\), then \\(\\frac{1}{z} = \\frac{\\overline{z}}{16}\\).\n\n### Step 10\nSo, the expression becomes:\n\n### Step 11\n\\[\n(75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i) \\cdot \\frac{\\overline{z}}{16} = (75 + 117i)z + \\left(6 + 9i\\right)\\overline{z}\n\\]\n\n### Step 12\nThat's a bit cleaner.

So, our objective is to maximize \\(81a - 108b\\) subject to \\(a^2 + b^2 = 16\\).\n\n### Step 24\nThis is a standard optimization problem with a constraint. We can use the method of Lagrange multipliers or consider it geometrically.\n\n### Step 25\nLet's consider it geometrically. The expression \\(81a - 108b\\) can be thought of as a dot product of the vectors \\((81, -108)\\) and \\((a, b)\\). Given that \\(a^2 + b^2 = 16\\), which is a circle of radius 4 centered at the origin.\n\n### Step 26\nThe maximum value of the dot product occurs when \\((a, b)\\) is in the same direction as \\((81, -108)\\). So, the maximum value is the magnitude of \\((81, -108)\\) times the magnitude of \\((a, b)\\), which is 4.\n\n### Step 27\nFirst, let's find the magnitude of \\((81, -108)\\):\n\n### Step 28\n\\[\n\\sqrt{81^2 + (-108)^2} = \\sqrt{6561 + 11664} = \\sqrt{18225} = 135\n\\]\n\n### Step 29\nTherefore, the maximum value of \\(81a - 108b\\) is \\(135 \\times 4 = 540\\).\n\n### Step 30\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. The magnitude of \\((81, -108)\\) is indeed \\(\\sqrt{81^2 + (-108)^2} = \\sqrt{6561 + 11664} = \\sqrt{18225} = 135\\). And since \\(a^2 + b^2 = 16\\), the maximum value of the dot product is \\(135 \\times 4 = 540\\).\n\n### Step 31\nBut let's confirm if this is achievable. That is, does there exist \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) with \\(a^2 + b^2 = 16\\) such that \\(81a - 108b = 540\\)?\n\n### Step 32\nLet's see. If \\((a, b)\\) is in the direction of \\((81, -108)\\), then we can write \\((a, b) = k(81, -108)\\), where \\(k\\) is a scalar.\n\n### Step 33\nGiven that \\(a^2 + b^2 = 16\\), we have:\n\n### Step 34\n\\[\nk^2(81^2 + (-108)^2) = 16\n\\]\n\n### Step 35\n\\[\nk^2(6561 + 11664) = 16\n\\]\n\n### Step 36\n\\[\nk^2(18225) = 16\n\\]\n\n### Step 37\n\\[\nk^2 = \\frac{16}{18225}\n\\]\n\n### Step 38\n\\[\nk = \\pm \\frac{4}{135}\n\\]\n\n### Step 39\nTaking the positive \\(k\\) for the maximum value:\n\n### Step 40\n\\[\n(a, b) = \\frac{4}{135}(81, -108) = \\left( \\frac{4 \\times 81}{135}, \\frac{4 \\times (-108)}{135} \\right) = \\left( \\frac{324}{135}, \\frac{-432}{135} \\right) = \\left( \\frac{36}{15}, \\frac{-48}{15} \\right) = \\left( \\frac{12}{5}, \\frac{-16}{5} \\right)\n\\]\n\n### Step 41\nNow, check if \\(a^2 + b^2 = 16\\):\n\n### Step 42\n\\[\n\\left( \\frac{12}{5} \\right)^2 + \\left( \\frac{-16}{5} \\right)^2 = \\frac{144}{25} + \\frac{256}{25} = \\frac{400}{25} = 16\n\\]\n\n### Step 43\nGood, it satisfies the constraint.

Enter your answer in the form $(r,\\\\theta),$ where $r > 0$ and $0 \\\\le \\\\theta < 2 \\\\pi.$'\n\"\"\"\n\nSolution:\n\"\"\"\n### STEP 1\nSo I have this problem here: convert the point (0,3) in rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates. I need to find the polar coordinates in the form (r, \u03b8), where r is greater than 0 and \u03b8 is between 0 and 2\u03c0. Alright, let's start by recalling how to convert from rectangular (Cartesian) coordinates to polar coordinates.\n\n### STEP 2\nI know that in polar coordinates, a point is defined by its distance from the origin (that's r) and the angle it makes with the positive x-axis (that's \u03b8). The formulas to convert from rectangular coordinates (x, y) to polar coordinates (r, \u03b8) are:\n\n### STEP 3\nr = \u221a(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)\n\n### STEP 4\n\u03b8 = arctan(y/x)\n\n### STEP 5\nBut I have to be careful with the angle \u03b8 because the arctan function only returns values between -\u03c0/2 and \u03c0/2, and I need to adjust it based on the quadrant in which the point lies to get the correct angle between 0 and 2\u03c0.\n\n### STEP 6\nGiven the point (0,3), let's identify x and y:\n\n### STEP 7\nx = 0\n\n### STEP 8\ny = 3\n\n### STEP 9\nFirst, let's find r:\n\n### STEP 10\nr = \u221a(0\u00b2 + 3\u00b2) = \u221a(0 + 9) = \u221a9 = 3\n\n### STEP 11\nSo, r = 3.\n\n### STEP 12\nNow, let's find \u03b8. The formula is \u03b8 = arctan(y/x), but in this case, x = 0, which would make the denominator zero. That means tan\u03b8 is undefined, which happens at angles where \u03b8 is \u03c0/2 or 3\u03c0/2.\n\n### STEP 13\nLooking at the point (0,3), it's located on the positive y-axis. So, the angle from the positive x-axis to the positive y-axis is \u03c0/2 radians (90 degrees).\n\n### STEP 14\nTherefore, \u03b8 = \u03c0/2.\n\n### STEP 15\nSo, the polar coordinates should be (3, \u03c0/2).\n\n### STEP 16\nBut just to double-check, let's consider the conditions for \u03b8. Since the point is on the positive y-axis, and the arctan function would normally return -\u03c0/2 or \u03c0/2, but in this case, because x is 0 and y is positive, \u03b8 is indeed \u03c0/2.\n\n### STEP 17\nAlso, since r is positive and \u03b8 is between 0 and 2\u03c0, this satisfies the requirements.\n\n### STEP 18\nTherefore, the polar coordinates are (3, \u03c0/2).\n\n### STEP 19\n**Final Answer**\n\n### STEP 20\n\\[ \\boxed{\\left(3,\\,\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)} \\]\n\"\"\"\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Explanation:\n\nSolution Analysis: We will begin by examining the steps that explicitly contain the answer.
